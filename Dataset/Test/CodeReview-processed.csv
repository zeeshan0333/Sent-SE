1,this actually happen wouldnt revision have to have so the previous comparison would be false
2,suggest to add a wrapper class like and keep the api attach and detach stable
3,is more like an invalid option not out of memory
4,might even want to change in this source to use routines as a part of this patch or separately
5,breaks e if you need this information you need to reimplement e yourself if go build a std then if then exit fi fi
6,comment doesnt sound right this if statement should be removed as lapd_handle should already be populated
7,keep finding myself wanting to click on the link that says click image to edit can we make that part of the link
8,slerp i was thinking of URL doesnt seem to be in all caps is this something else it does say somewhere to avoid acronyms but there are exceptions this may be one of them
9,the current situation core plugins are developed by core team experimental developed by pi and mosengineering teams in the future core plugins certified by mirantis experimental verified by mirantis and thirdparty other plugins
10,suppose this is readable but its a lot of boilerplate compared to having a single callback each for with the if in the body
11,all build tools use j thus the simpler approach of directly setting j4 might be better
12,noted in patch set message should be cannot remove storage pool with non master domains or something
13,think the cleanest style here would be to make this and then embed maybe into classlinker as iscompiledimagemethod itd be nice to avoid exposing the debugger to inner notions of oat files
14,of putting everything in the collector and then looping through later when why not switch here on outputformat and thus allow results to be printed immediately for json and collected only for json_single
15,condition is always true i assume the condition you meant was n ptrsize though i see you removed this condition altogether in cl rebase failure
16,but children and whose children aint english EMO_POS
17,i dont know why it is like this in the login but not in the logout i would assume it should be the same in both places and that this one is the more robust one
18,i agree theres a sense that the state of the machine is not const
19,as above astr nsttnfml
20,might want to support z here since thats coming in a day or two
21,a question does ant use as a path separator on all platforms or should you use file.pathseparator which will be on windows
22,think should this be m_yoffset instead because will make the rectangle grow
23,this just a bad formatting here or is clangformat to blame i would prefer to put the name and type on a single line in that case separating the seems wrong in a lot of ways
24,forgot to cherrypick that one thanks for noticing fixed
25,you need to check success
26,do not like long very much but that is something in the inode_ctx api maybe i find the courage one day to make it a instead
27,in the debug code below but id add a comment here saying something like n p base s.elemsize using division by modular multiplication
28,what i can gather asciidoc should be camelcase URL
29,suggested to add aliases in this comment URL
30,memory is too small consider buying a ram d
31,is what i figured even if we define a column type as integer it is still allowed by sqlalchemy to have strings this allowed user_id to be stored as string regardless of its definition.things would fail when we have ldap and a regular db like postgres however this is present in other models like tokens where user_id is defined as integer.so this all together should be a separate issue
32,this moved to config.h instead of having it on the command line
33,this to the duplicate mathoid is so if you have any other repos eventually or a temp dir or an output dir it can all be in the same place
34,i know see you have fixed almost all places thanks
35,keep all lowercase or make it a real sentence and end in period
36,while assimulating is a word that seem to exist my only association was that it was a misspelling of assimilate this leads me to believe that its a word that nonnative english readers might have trouble interpreting the right nuance of this is the commit message however so in this case it isnt the end of the world not many will read it compared to the actual guide EMO_POS
37,is a core class why should it be independent from core usage if you just assign an end date you have to jump in the source code to become an idea how the start date is resolved this can be written into the function comment so if we may change we do not need to change so much calls
38,need refresh freq_demote here otherwise we wont be able to change the frequency from the cli
39,causes a warning about missing uid in eclipse fixed with URL
40,i just left a related question on the rename cl EMO_POS lets discuss this irl
41,but this is usual wording we are using git grep member of the privileged administrators group wc l
42,thanks the approach here and in my patch work fine if the user controls everything they way they want when autodetecting everything this patch is better on nonavx hardware that happens to have rdtscp otherwise they effectively work the same when compiling on a new build host for old compute nodes this patch will sometimes require the user to make two active settings to make a functional mdrun that might mean they go hunting for docs twice unless they find the new install guide section at least we dont fail mysteriously any more when compiling on an old build host for new compute nodes both patches will sometimes make an mdrun that could be better in up to two ways we could add a nag message for the double negation of the new code in gmx_detect_hardware.c you too could be using rdtscp afaik the proposition that using rdtscp is good in user space is just educated guesswork though i was slightly concerned about one of the latter cases build host is old user knows they have avx on the compute nodes so they know to set simd and dont know rdtscp exists is relevant but if we add the new nag then this case is solved well enough so im happy to adopt this solution thanks shall i abandon my patch send reviewers here and one of us work on eriks feedback the new nag if we add the nag commit message needs updating
43,they are most of the shorter methods are from media foundation sdk example
44,this seems like a hack to work around a bug why are we reading from the pty after it is closed this hack also looks too broad if any error occurs we close the pipe and stop reading while squelching the error this seems bad same comments below
45,im not sure how best to handle this stackoverflow has a display name attribute does anything similar exist for ldap openid id prefer to just show the firstname to save on space if we end up showing the full name i wonder if we could put the name to the left of the search bar and have the search bar expand over it when active to save on horizontal space
46,type would be vs ptrseccertificategetdata though i suggest moving the typedefs below the qt_begin_namespace at line feel free to ignore this suggestion though since its valid either way
47,would remove the setter and have a public getter you could always spy
48,this the same thing as cramtmp can we use that to make it more obvious its a tmp directory
49,built search tree of is not preserved on you have to call build_tree here or do it just before use and use is_tree_valid to check if it is necessary as every line is used more than once
50,length expected here is but field below is ft_int32 is this an unsigned short ft_uint16
51,got an exception expecting eof found registered
52,added qt_deprecated_since check and changed to qt_deprecated
53,believe greg thinks there may be a performance difference depending on ssl termination in the pipeline but i think hes wrong for our apis and clients we could test or we can review after we get something working and revisit it later if there is problems
54,you mean will be removed from the group if so id add the from the group to avoid confusion some might think that the user is going to be removed from the system i.e deleted there are a couple of minor white spaces here shown in red
55,seems to me that the above helpers would be better suited in a different file to keep this file a purely generator one does that make sense is there any good reason to keep it here
56,general way to do this is etc etc
57,guess this change new will be handled in a separate patch
58,we have metadataupdate that is batchoriented or we dont it doesnt make any sense to change the batch behavior for the same instance after it was created ever so drop that setter and add second assisted inject constructor that accepts batchrefupdate parameter instead and make the batch field final as pointed out above
59,since were doing this might as well do this instead since its cleaner and looks better and sanitized elements data and before you dismiss the usage of getattr thats actually how wmi namespaces work the method is overriden and it will lookup and cache that class_name and return it as it does not have it defined this way it is more flexible same wmi module works for any namespace
60,would be consistent with the methods above
61,is sufficient prefix no need for we should be plural like changes heads and tags
62,of malloc maybe you can use stack gchar is enough cannot be greater
63,could put the finalizeforcommandline after processexceptionatexit then it doesnt change anything for lib_mpi and that wouldnt work anyhow as you point out
64,probably is but what happens when somebody upgrades the libvirt do we require vdsm restart as well or will it suddenly start working
65,is still wrong
66,impossible to say until somebody invests the time and effort to try lots of different function approximations on that architecture to see if they can come up with something better for now it is the fastest approach
67,assuming the modelservice works EMO_POS this private method does not rely on other services also model service may have issues with elements that have the same id in theory i could put the same element with the same id multiple times in a menu i dont know if modelservice would be able to resolve that at least here we can count and validate if need be i will make the other changes and await response on this
68,we missed a usecase here im affraid that i know why this wasnt implemented yet this doesnt check if the files inside the deleted folder have active references like is done above see also URL
69,the callee the callee expect me to i mean
70,second sought actually you dont need this file endpoint at all we have already post that creates a change and what are you doing here is to delegate to its apply method after translating your own input to changeinfo the only reason to have this class is to get the uiaction for granted guice dynamicitem binding and discovery but you could solve this in different way just construct uiaction on you own in projectjson and add it to actions map manually see an example how its done in inlineedit series now on the client side from your custom uiaction you can invoke the original rest endpoint post the only difference to current solution you would need to pass project name too obviously this also raises the question do we want to have this button on project info screen at all we could add it to main page or may be just add a keyboard shortcut in wich case we are not in project context any more and the dialog must be extended to provide project name with suggestion oracle for project like it already does for branches i dont have strong preference for one of these solutions so you can let it as is for now and wait for opinion of other reveiwers URL
71,includes the trailing couple more of this
72,calls dont do the same thing as a result locknow must be called unconditionally
73,this is still unacceptable is used by both the binary export and the ooxml filter you need to set the ooxml flag in the ooxml filter jut put a breakpoint on this line in the debugger see its backtrace and set the flag in the first method that is already ooxmlspecific and pass the bool around till this line
74,we are starting an rpc for every row in the table my concern with this is the browser can only issue requests at a time to the server if a user has items in their dashboard which many do this will take quite a few roundtrips to completely load the status codes worse if the user navigates away before they are completely done loading they will continue to load as there is no way to cancel the queued rpcs i would prefer having myapprovals and strongestapprovals take a and return a and make only one call to each method for the dashboard
75,should only be added if the rgbz view plugin is going to be built maybe the proper place to add this test is in that plugin
76,yes perhaps i should change the commit message its because the policy was set to new so it will do nothing anyway as we are already using cmake
77,URL
78,objectcollapsiblebutton to objectcollapsiblebox or objectcollapsiblegroupbox
79,very concerned that this is done at nonobvious place it will be hard to observe that rpcs are found replied late in our context we dont have any tests for this if something is changed then when well notice
80,you dig into the code at some point you will reach a very strange statement a couple of calls from setcachesize the size reported by that might differ from the size specified by the caller in which case the caller should be informed of that if you query cachesize you will get the value of the variable not the value that was adjusted after the calls
81,way to remove this constant and use information from setup.cfg import os read setup.cfg of osprofiler setup.cfg as setup_file setup_lines setup_file.readlines parse version for line in setup_lines if EMO_NEG version
82,call for single line that removes from dict
83,monitoring it is about to change soon
84,to URL its bundle version should be evolved along with its host plugin i.e org.eclipse.jdt.ui which will become now hence i updated the same for the test bundle i will upload a new patch set with
85,are you going to manager function if glusterd_svc_check_volfile_identical function will failed you should simply return error
86,the names weve thought of for this suck unfortunately EMO_NEG
87,a collection to be searchable there has to be explicit backend support its not generic you dont get it for free so unless implemented search for gluster volumes in the backend the user will not be able to search so unless you did indeed implement this in backend please remove this url parameter
88,we should use deltapos here because the actual movements of the point may be changed according to the logic above
89,parameter doesnt currently exist in compat i dont know why it is being introduced here
90,i can switch over to a whitelist i just killed the ones i really didnt like e.g md5 EMO_POS
91,after main inode is what patchset has done i think
92,spaces rather than tabs here for consistency
93,this could be outputwriter instead of writer2
94,this include also the lj pme contribution either summed our as a separate line i know that this functionality may change in the future but for now would be better to keep uptodate
95,is it safe to use it in production or should we add a warning that it should be disabled before putting your app in prod if its safe to use it in production how about enabling it by default or do we push it to gwt
96,use one of the test helper methods which includes a timeout combining the takeresults into this method does not seem like enough of a reason to add a new wait method we need to be able to adjust the timeouts in auto testing so minimizing the number of helper methods is rather important
97,no actual need to have this routine similar to how its done in bitrotscrub.c since there just one option to reconfigure keep it simple and just do a in the appropriate function
98,means error_expected create its means there are nor error then its better to use none by default for none and you set string in error_expected by default value is boolean python allows it but its not good to change the type of variable
99,xdata is the response dict i think you need to use xdata which is received in marker_rename
100,is because that was previously in this script URL
101,this is not sufficient you also need to call checkxvgfile using this second data instance and please create a separate scope for this so that the previous testreferencedata object is destructed before this one is created otherwise its difficult to reason that things work as expected since there is a bit unfortunately a lot of logic in the destructor
102,use of count confuses me would this be cleaner method call
103,this just be func run etc and have callers explicitly call register beforehand
104,could eventually create hf entry per size for sizes bits you can use the same filter name but for those above bits you need another filter name as seen in readme.dissector chapter
105,the err at the end its the result of the last possible test making it probably meaningless and possibly misleading
106,think this should say alias for gerrit remove plugin see line
107,second key is not needed this array contains a list of regex group names pointing to a key
108,toolchain file should stop here it should be about description and setting compilers period see URL i figure the principle is that the toolchain files are somewhat transferable between projects
109,shared_pointer is probably the way to go if youre happy with the cost of refcounting them
110,any_diff has a huge impact on performance typically there are many thousands of unchanged objects and only a few changed with any_diff filter you will only traverse the changed objects otherwise all of them
111,is no putcomment method shorten this and just put it on one line null setpatchsetid must be called first developers debugging a failure can look at the java stack trace to see how they got into this situation what matters to them more is the call site where the object was misused not which entry point into the object the error was discovered by
112,shouldnt need at all just naming the executable target will work because knows to translate a target name appearing just after command into the right path this is already done for the other tests
113,to when the trace is not present
114,think this parameter is unnecessary because having a user object instance implies that youre checking things for that one particular user account plus it doesnt really seem to be used
115,point is that div_fsys1 is probably a fixed size as defined by the data sheet and an unsigned int is not so if its a bit value as suggested by the fact that youre reading it with readl below you should use uint32_t to ensure its the right size that struct might need to be fixed up too
116,were changing the names of these triggers lets fix the spelling of the word exceed as well i think unmark_quota_exceed_upd_set should still be short enough
117,you suggested in person that probably should go into a template
118,i am an administrator i will look into the log file to find what is happening in vdsm you can not suppose administrator to check the console or the code to know this imo every faulty path should have a log in the log file you can argue that many places in vdsm are not doing these but it is a good practice for system service program
119,sitting in so no need to repeat this
120,think it is better to pass accesscanner reference to the constructor instead of checking null here
121,will never be true if its of type unsigned int
122,point i think it is related to the change as the new message is introduced here
123,was directly copied by but you are right
124,set looks good to me approved i concur with jrbarnetteUSER_MENTION it sounds like we can do a separate for removing the pragma to that end i think a todo referring to that issue could be useful if added to this cl
125,hopefully the text is also otherwise a bit clearer
126,that make sense why not just leave the reservation
127,few paragraphs look more like they should be code comments than change description if there isnt a good place to put them in the code maybe we should start an engineinternals.qdoc file which is one big block
128,sure about this method it seems to make sense to me the way dan explained it but im not comfortable giving this change a since i didnt write any of the original code and may not be aware of all of the issues
129,we club these two cases something like case gf_snap_option_type_activate gf_snap_option_type_deactivate
130,address the previous concerns about constructing a massive qbytearray in the case of no terminating character i set pos2 to pos so that the qbytearray is empty in that case
131,to use with EMO_NEG
132,encode the value right away instead we should lazily encode the value only when the serialization stream needs it thus the constructor is just this.object object this.codec codec this.hash object.hashcode
133,set i would prefer that you didnt submit this inline comment lgtm after a small bug fix
134,should probably be moved above the check so that unknown options on openbsd also force cgo lookups
135,whether ret needs to be initialised to enomem here because its caller is expecting it to contain errno
136,propvalue parameter type is not quite idiomatic EMO_POS in general since this method gets called multiple times prolly worth buffering the xml
137,have added the modulo because if int is actually bits then the snprintf would mangle the string for values otoh it is quite unlikely that we ever see such high numbers but you are right it is not really a good solution ill push a version that will work with bits ints and the refined error message thanks a lot for taking the time to write the review
138,appears the requisite form is elseif so i left this one asis typo3 code must not use the else if construct URL
139,to pending since
140,this sentence has six commas and two separate alternations ors maybe it could be split up
141,to be space around the eg
142,set looks good to me but someone else must approve looks fine though agree with chriss comment that exported strings should be defined in a header file that can be shared
143,think we use spaces instead of tabs after variable name all USER_MENTION above
144,think hes looking for the exact string h the is to count the terminating at the end
145,your account or email address does not exist
146,is press and is setfocus do you plan to move this to qaccessiblewidget i guess that makes sense
147,set looks good to me but someone else must approve rebased with current master took comments into account using in deprecation log as it is like that in config_default but using USER_MENTION with and remove in to stick to our rules
148,this script will go in itks tree and not the hooks it should be licensed as the rest of itk which will soon be apache but is not yet afaik besides the rest of the apache license infrastructure license and notice is not present yet also we should assign the copyright to the insight software consortium for code going in itk proper
149,these transient and lets just handle the serialization entirely ourselves that way we dont have to actually hold onto buf when we have the object form already on hand
150,it should be possible to test this with only osts with a twostripe file it would be missing stripe index
151,means well have to add an extra boolean field to every member itll make serialization size bigger as well as resident ast memory go up im happy to change it but it seems like it trades off memory for readability youd still have to handle because thats the way java annotations work you cannot have a default value of null
152,neither i am just writing functional tests for this gimme a sec
153,this is a kind of helper method id suggest then making it private def flavor EMO_NEG
154,mode of both files was changed to that means the executable bit was added
155,p.s i was confused between ebadf and ebadfd then i tried to be consistent as i see libgfapi returning ebadfd in several other methods when glfs_resolve_fd fails
156,martin i will do it it will look much better
157,is intended we are already making sure that multiple events are okay for us see onhashchanged so i think this is the most practical way
158,main thing about dev mode off is that it works even when the code server isnt running perhaps its less useful with this change but i dont want to remove it yet
159,sure why we need this since its a read
160,now streaming the progress to the client done
161,delete next three lines also given that now its just the callersp everywhere including in the defer struct field name
162,this a dict_get failed rather than a dict_set
163,should probably be dlfcn but im not sure it might be better to split this into another file and call it something like pthread_dlfcn_test.cpp to indicate this is really a test that is also testing dl related functionality
164,not level we dont care about warnings in thirdparty code using level could actually the level depending on the actual build flags
165,do realize that the given glfd pointer could now have been reallocated and hence pass all these checks still and crash right just checking EMO_POS ideally if we want to validate that this is a good pointer which we sort of cannot unless we have a table of valid pointers and check against that etc or hand out numbers and map that into a table
166,doesnt this failure mean i couldnt read the command file for which no command doesnt seem like a bad error
167,point is that lets maintain our own configs even fi they are the same as the default ones and change them soon by considering various factors including perf results
168,just noticed this please change god_mode to override_state as in this change URL
169,did some refactoring and missed changing this name thanks for catching it
170,if the number of neighbors integer type can be obtained as a trait from the kdtree class move body to hxx use
171,is weird here too imageid is a property but provider is a toplevel attribute of a resource its also being used here with a different meaning to what has been understood to date see above
172,dont believe that typename is needed here since there is a template present
173,set currently our enums reflect the superset of the devices which are supported yeah we are not allow flexibility at this stage
174,add tests for fopen we should test the different modes
175,assume this is not a memmap version of
176,sure why this one is confusing it returns the list of files so it has to be immediate and it returns the files in that directory not ones in sub directories
177,code this will read mgr.mgr if move to svc package it would read svc.mgr also lets just name in manager so svc.manager
178,prefer the increased type safety of enum classes
179,would be helpful if the returned structure were described more fully just for clarity
180,david turner wrote hmm this is a bit hard to understand may i suggest you to replace it with the following xx the invocation on the first line has been commented out because it doesnt work on freebsd which uses instead of note that with this comment this script is invoked with the right bash shell from well your version is more easy to understand ill replace comment in ammended commit
181,an excellent day when theres more documentation than the core developers can remember having
182,should be alright to change as if it wasnt updated in the last install this one will run both work as upgrade paths as it tests with no salt set if nessecary
183,URL
184,cannot design an api for logging we should take out the command argument and have generic errors its easy looking at vdsm.log to discover what was the command executed before this failure
185,i dont think we used such rules for comments though maybe or
186,the msgs above have significance that they are trying to modify pgfid create one message id say p_msg_pgfid_op and log errors there
187,dont need to put this xml or a new test class that means in a previous test case you can just do following USER_MENTION USER_MENTION webapiusage value resistance public void testanimationimpinresistancemode your test code here
188,so there will be some problems here i mean to authorise we need token is really not supported in that version of nova_client dunno what password to use here where were using ctx from trust using service user creds here is not really a good idea
189,putting text documenting whats happening here we shuould start documenting nonobvious stuff
190,it be worth putting here to get the echoed output and exit status
191,too you can access mabasecell.mfvalue directly since we know ahead of time that both cells are of value type
192,we get this from cpuid instead of hard coding it
193,are you going to manager function if glusterd_svc_check_volfile_identical function will failed you should simply return error same comments apply for all reconfigure function if you have done same things
194,explain what part of mdd_object_create you need to reuse except mdo_create
195,explain in this file why the compiler was failing and dxs behavior
196,think somebody just chose to put the alltests class in a separate package from the other test classes i dont know why but they arent integrationstyle tests they seem to be closer to unitstyle
197,ugh really thats how i read URL at least so do we need an mdns.allow parser too even nssmdns discourages using the file please note that usually mdns is not used for anything but local hence you usually dont want to touch this file so you can probably just fall back to cgo if you detect its existence
198,the servicename have other characters at this point
199,previous one says server assigned is the difference intentional
200,add a commented out example of packetfoo.src
201,think that this class makes more sense than the branch class because there are several places in gerrit where refs strings are manipulated without using branch objects jgit does define some of those constants but we cannot use jgit everywhere particularly in gwt which i suspect is why this class is here in the first place we need a good place in gerrit for these constants and the branch object itself is a much higher level object than this simple class it isnt only about refs but rather refs and projects these constants feel more appropriate here to me than in the branch class i have some more changes which i will push which move them out of the branch class completely i am willing to update the comment here if need be but this class feels appropriate to me based on its name and location and i dont think that naive comment should get in the way of that
202,testchanges prefer foobar over barforfoo is redundant with the package name says implementation e.g fake of foo for tests while testfoos says static methods for dealing with foos its not super compelling but hey at least its shorter
203,of having of im thinking it should be belonging to i feel that both page belonging to group and page a belonging to robert lyon make more sense than page of group and page a of robert lyon
204,avoid having commented out code delete the dcheck which looks wrong to me anyway you certainly could have a const index but backends are under no obligation to take advantage of that information
205,wrap before throws so the line isnt over columns
206,related but may be better to move to suffix or something like that
207,a preemptive note i put these todos in the code because they are separate refactoring issues which would be better handled in a separate bug
208,i forgot your that cl EMO_POS however stlport_whitelist isnt defined yet at this point in config.mk it loads envsetup.mk which eventually loads the product makefiles before it defines stlport_whitelist on the other hand we can remove libstlport from this file and add it to specific devices makefile such as id really like to keep the device names out of the build project
209,seems like calling window.location.replace would reload the page if it doesnt in this case is that portable
210,thats a uintptr_t then you again dont need this double cast
211,i misunderstood martins comment but yes i create a new changeid in changeutil so this is expected and by design but it has nothing to do with the footers i do not change the changeid in the commit message since that is not expected git would never do it i personally do not want the new change to have the same changeid internally as the old change is that something you really want
212,this import is not needed anymore and can be removed
213,this is still a parameter so you should probably leave the line
214,is no more initialized with this change
215,nit this could go on the same line as excludes
216,here please use empty lines instead of the ugly separators in this file it is too compact and hard to read after your change
217,descriptions in vtk must always start with this description if this line is missing then the automatic document generation will not work
218,main points are hat we avoid to repeat the code block below twice or three when merging the jre task and reading each task is easier to know exactly what the diferences ares
219,lov_unpackmd EMO_NEG variable dereferenced before check lmm see line
220,this is tricky to use an enum because this is going to be mostly dynamic based on the content of the images folder
221,is not right use space and not tab
222,control keywords must be followed by a single space
223,add a guard to prevent surprises if db.isbare return null
224,its not set theres no way to get fsp failure data out i agree that its not an absolute requirement but without it if theres a failure youre going to be pretty lost we could move it from here and put this below surrounding the if statements and not actually fail but my opinion was this was the best option
225,wording the sentence doesnt make sense perhaps support creating a request for authentication of a remote
226,not use if elseif
227,dont think there is an easy way to do this but it feels like these error messages should be shared with the ones from the wui approvaltable
228,definition nothing is required when we have macros telling whether it is present or not to avoid having to update this file every time something in one of the implementation files changes i would move that documentation there this file is simply about simd and defining simd properties not about what simd instructions are used in different kernels specific comments about verlet kernels belong in the verlet kernel code not here
229,if we get rid of nindex we would have to change a lot of code because in this one the insert method returns the index of the existing element
230,comment is a lie EMO_POS it has almost entirely bit rotted at this point ill push an update upstream we def support executing via other tools as we use it that way in other places wrt path unless dbus itself resets the path it should inherit the active one which will include that i dont consider this a leakage
231,true false and null must be uppercase expected false but found false
232,code style thing please remove the extraneous parentheses around
233,this is never called then we need to remove the method its signature in the header and all callsites for it right
234,that im really looking at the code would not the right fix be to change toknext to be signed instead of unsigned so that the for loop stops immediately or to check that it is if tokens null then will always be set to that said your change is somehow equivalent so we could keep it asis
235,point ill move to the other block of itkdeprecatedtestdriver
236,dont do that keep the if condition stmt structure
237,line either break into multiple lines or add a static import
238,i prefer to have only with space after comma
239,will take my share of the blame here we dont need equals or hashcode at all they come for free from stringkey and i added them for no reason way back in i5df6f0c5 and nothing personal sven you know how it is when youve spent all afternoon debugging such a mysterious bug in production
240,think this is really needed see comments in partialstatesystem also protected fields no no
241,much repetition EMO_NEG can you pull this out as some kind of utility function setup_loopback_mode perhaps create an mbimtestcase subclass call mbimdatatestcase
242,remember filtering name can be related to expert information this give you more filtering options for example btle.crc.incorrect and incorrect crc
243,i see what you mean yeah it might be possible to do what you describe
244,style comments and i guess includ pcap.h be garded with ifdef have_libpcap
245,should be done if any when first connection is established and i do think that it is a mistake to do so please move all the engine variables into engine side do not modify options there is no technical need to do so this includes the destination address and destination port lets makes lives easier for us if you call the variable the same you can even have same file symlinked at and to provide the same options so you can even consider putting it at engine local config but please avoid complexity result from database updates and move the variables to the component that actually use them
246,think the per stream flow control wont be implemented please double check with mike and remove this code in case it wont be implemented and the spec updated
247,about setting arg and remove
248,patch evelvate context to fix tempest exeption unauthorized
249,set fails this cl is breaking the cq please try running it against a x86 board like x86alex or x86generic before resubmitting make j32 runtests using qemu for testing copying qemu binary cp cannot stat no such file or directory make error error failed test phase EMO_NEG
250,place functions in tags throughout
251,i dont think so since it probably contains the version of the metamodel which varies over time
252,dont see this as needing more prominence here so much as the increase in docs is entire second wedged into this one id vote for merging as is and making the docs process a standalone followup
253,do not understand i am not trying to fix the world now all i need is to ask vdsm what is its id without having to deal with handling the are the above valid to this task the new code of vdsmreg will call vdsmtool vdsmid force and get id no matter if it is uuid or generated from anywhere else this id is required for registration if you then want to improve how it is generated you are welcome to do so it will not break the interface
254,we converted helper code to groovy we would have the elvis operator and closures to handle the idiom just sayin EMO_POS
255,could use from heattestcase that does all the boilerplate for you or use USER_MENTION as class decorator as you seem to use this mock in all tests
256,should really check self.client.can_send_version and send the primitive of the object with the old version if you cant send the new one you can find examples of this in
257,it sounds funny i should fix it your explanation is a good approximation of whats happening we are limiting traffic any suggestion for how to improve hmm i think i see what you mean we are not changing the amount of traffic just the proportion of that traffic which is going to the campaign what about throttle impressions
258,this change apply to all uses of this rule i suggest making this plural form optional so people can transition to using it over time rather than flooding them with warnings
259,we really need a separate header for two trivial definitions
260,did you make this change i think it makes sense to have the assertion
261,use i also rebased on latest master and adjusted look and feel of buttons here to match the changes made in context of URL
262,probably want tvb_reported_length_remaining here
263,spaces to relation name to match those in type definition
264,certainly can use the errno here as we are invokingfork
265,code refreshlabelimagejob and permissionauthoritysessionmanagerlistener could be encapsulated in a single class whose responsability is to manage lock decorations update and this class could be named lockdecorationupdater like that this class could be reused for potential others views
266,the error message and is that with the latest transform change
267,was being consistent with the hybrid pdf tooltip which used makes
268,think were better off just taking the autogenerated stub like we did in the original patch it doesnt hurt anyone that theres dead code at the end because the syscall never returns and its arguably more confusing to be insisting on supplying our own stub
269,USER_MENTION void is redundant leave it out but do add a line USER_MENTION libreoffice
270,readability i prefer an inverted condition as guard clause
271,be renamed together with the class it tests
272,one less file to update for anyone adding an extcap executable i was hoping to migrate the windows buildbots to cmake this week which would make this less critical
273,switches on distinct locales only not on a primary language value where the secondary value may be different this should instead be switch ctl language_mask_primary and
274,right the issue is that the onsampleselected callback uses the combo index to fetch the sample from msamplepath so the way you have it they dont match if you try selecting a sample will load a different one the trivial solution is to sort msamplepaths alphabetically like it should have been done in the first place anyway my fault for forgetting that
275,is more information URL about alternative
276,think this switch statement is getting big enough that this dissector should create a dissector table and have these dissectors register with it not the other way around
277,must i disagree but its a matter of style consider though documenting the fact that the other methods days are numbered
278,a space after cms so it read typo3 cms same for cms8
279,took out the cast that was causing the warning i think
280,is great it also means you can move that line outside of the you also need another in6_addr you have to have both dest and gateway though for default and host you only use one or the other same is needed in the v4 case
281,think theres a function for doing this maybe display_name i think you pass it a whole usr record and viewer and it figures out how to display it
282,can go back and change this to the version if it gets too difficult to figure out whats going on
283,to match the interface or else rename all of them dashboardserviceimpl dashboardservice dashboardserviceasync
284,ill check if still works with asiidoctor before pursuing it any further then URL
285,sorry ill fix this in the upstream well its my upstream after all and add a patch to the queue to update the library
286,define this is the h file please run kwstyle
287,only move bonds to the same place or back so bond j is always tested in the extreme case there are no hbonds and the loop is simply a copy from i to also note that this code has been tested in the nbnxn_hybrid_acc branch
288,you must continue the original numbering and then update last_str_here
289,is the default so i suggest we remove it ive never seen it used before and it just made me scratch my head as to what it was for
290,catch debugging needs to be removed will remove in next patch set
291,instead of whitespaces as in the rest of the file
292,onboard devices instead of setting them to off can break the chipset configuration this is the entire reason for this stuff to be in a devicetree.cb and to make the static.c to point to the correct setup functions these devices are always on the board and the chip configuration will enable and disable and hide them based on the platform configuration and the device tree without this everything would be a normal pci device enumeration and coreboot would be much much simpler i also agree with martin that as a reference design it is important to show the configuration as clearly as possible
293,is no vdsm action here only database just make the command transactive and save yourself all this hassle
294,use double quotes for and these headers are now local same comment for other files including them
295,is a misrendering in gerrit the actual code is properly indented
296,instead of so the caret is nicely positioned under the start of the function name
297,these files are still generated by autogen.sh if no autogen.input is present and when i asked on irc people told me they are still used actually i was told to keep the minimized info message to move config from autogen.lastrun.bak to autogen.input instead of some more prominent header i actually dont see a reason to deprecate the configuration via autogen.sh commandline arguments for me autogen.input is just an other way to configure stuff
298,the ret pointer will be freed outside of this function therefore i need to return a pointer here and is assigned null above instead of the g_new as before if id return just null it would add complexity to code outside
299,could be removed and use as parameter of the reset method
300,this one can use sha1 and another patch could change the existing instances
301,no really there is a mix on indent and it is tab by majority i will fix rest of file and add modelines
302,cleaning this regex remove empty string concatenation this can happen when we start a new group of concatenation see appendconcatoperation and there is nothing to print afterwards in this case the string ends with a concatenation of an empty string
303,need for this change this you are not using the e
304,commit mentions that a gcc change motivates forbidding fpie but i havent seen any reason to also forbid it for gcc that configuration has been not broken since qt maybe some rationale for that can be put into the changelog too because it would seem easy to check before deciding to error there also people using boost build and other nonqmake noncmake buildsystems too so limiting the error could have been wise
305,unable to get class information for USER_MENTION tag unabletocompleteexception
306,methods should also probably go in the anonymous namespace
307,a comma here can you help adding it back EMO_POS
308,of this simply add to method bellow
309,should be safe because this string isnt really used in the gui its used as one of the arguments in a later format string so its copied in fact i could and probably should just use null instead of packet_scope
310,youre at it would it make sense to fill in the remaining cases desktop music movies pictures etc the implementations which can be supported using a virtual file system i.e media types as long as the permission is set in the manifest can be added later but having the cases here already seems reasonable
311,may want to check for null because cbmem allocations can fail
312,sure the smbus code is compiled and linked in
313,aeffect
314,like it should be disabled it is reasonable to run a whole multisim workflow em equil phases simulate in the same set of multidirs so being able to use mdrun_mpi multidir deffnm equilnpt would be a nice thing i havent tried multidir with a nondefault equilnpt that i remember though should we be looking at doing the directory change for multidir earlier than we do
315,that these can be usually written simpler as just instead of oustring
316,guess this must be an unsigned integer because of the way we shift bits in the next file however in that case the width too is likely important and i would suggest using gmx_uint32_t for clarity
317,right is nonadmin tenant need to change to admin tennt id here will fix it in next patch
318,the error message to reflect that key size is big
319,are we allowing calls to nonexistent functions
320,takes a message so no need to change anything here
321,least put USER_MENTION something helps us keep track of what still needs to be looked at in the codebase
322,should not reset the current filter here but still need to use it for incoming read operations and then replace it with the new filter in an atomic way below
323,add a comment explaining why leaving a try statement in the ast with no catch blocks and no finally block would leave the ast in an unsafe state
324,call it getstartindices instead of the expected getseeds
325,better to have a log here rather than having gf_validate_or_goto the log can be gf_msg gf_log_error q_quota_inode_missing missing inode cant adjust for quota just add a enum with appropriate number associated to it there is no diagnosis for this
326,would be nice to use a dto for the options this would make it possible to extend it later which i am pretty sure we will do without breaking extensions using the interface
327,thats the point if its a plugin it needs to depend on designer as in the other example but this is a ui plugin only
328,both the if statements into one single if statement
329,is a warning unused variable w here im guessing this should compare w.size with right ill push a fix for that to master
330,make the comment style consistent so here it would go behind
331,here end with a single and the next line becomes
332,a way to create the logger elsewhere because we cannot specify in this configuration file a path where the user is allowed to write by default the file will be in the current eclipse install folder but as max pointed out many users ahve eclipse installed in a folder where theyre not allowed to write
333,doesnt make sense to me why can we distinguish it what depends on what happening before what
334,time describe to which repository theyre going
335,method looks really strange it seems to allow to get or create a view model context at the same time the parameter set is confusing it is not part of this review but please add a br to discuss this separatly
336,be nice to coalesce such case lists into a single line up to some line length
337,bootmode is allover the place in acpi too i was considering doing enum with followup later
338,just wondered how likely that would be in combination with ostringbuffer
339,indentation on these lines seems to be wrong same for backend call below
340,you add a quick comment something like return any uncommitted resources it took me minutes to figure this out even though i know most of this code already
341,you need to unlink all the socket files as well
342,could be changed i imagine but jenkins will probably add helpful spacing too EMO_NEG if there was a way to have jenkins keep a perbuild archive then we could have it make available the corrected files
343,may be a minor bug here in that there can be a tmpfail at authentication time this doesnt seem to handle that
344,really a fan of making it an error as it is perfectly legitimate policy maybe a warning
345,list of maintainers seems to be organized alphabetically by translator name i guess tiering should be listed after quota
346,is deprecated please use
347,defined itk_has_typetraits_tr1_namespace define itk_std_tr1_namespace else define itk_std_tr1_namepsace std endif
348,not so useful if a user had a class that was no longer sent to other applications the parcelable boiler plate code could be removed
349,of tv can put in this block but its not kernel code so its not a big deal
350,should be if
351,call new code uses ptal
352,you measured the performance difference with regionofinterestimagefilter
353,you add another test which uses line breaks after and before
354,tobias youve got a typo lenght length EMO_NEG i.e if firstchildsel.length thanks ghada
355,checking for null pointer here delete handles null pointers just fine you only add overhead here
356,name is very generic yet what it does is just poll for updates the problem goes away if the script moves to vdsmtool
357,robert dont really need these global variables here theyre not used within the function thanks ghada
358,the bug that i reported was actually on the change screen i had not observed the same issue on the project page yep the original fix was to fix the project page itd be great if we could fix both in one go
359,probably need to check for dividebyzero here since addr_len comes from compr which is based on packet data
360,should move this to some other module since it has very little to do with simd and it was only a hack for a single architecture however that will require us to write a different hardware module so for now ive added a define for gmx_simd when any of the simd architectures is enabled which is good to have anyway
361,instead of using contains above and section here one can use indexof above and mid here
362,name
363,these redundant copies of those in archagnostic
364,that needs to run in the ui thread needs to be wrapped this way otherwise the ide complains it is in the ui testing doc i sent you URL
365,dont always agree with paul but when i do im either drunk or i have a very good reason
366,problem is at the opensource side if this breaks the app people will try to debug it by themselves or worse they will just give up and do not update to the latest gwt version i dont want that to happen especially for this release on the other hand if somebody hits the problem it is easy to point them to the workaround this is not ideal situation but that is what i prefer right now
367,performance characteristics of arraylist should be similar enough to use here instead of introducing jsobjectarray
368,see here URL dev if dev dev if dev return current
369,tarball do you mean here i dont see why installing the file would matter for the source tarball which is the only thing we are currently interested in i tested and the install file ends up in the source tarball just fine even without this block but with the other changes here
370,rename this to extcapcapturefilter or similar the convention here is that the extcap arguments exist together with nonextcap arguments in a binary capture and fifo are the only exceptions because they start the process and fifo is a generic argument
371,not sure we would ever remove this when running the super dev mode from a static html page instead of a server people link directly to nocache.js so it should always exist
372,ive merged the two into
373,dont think so i am not familiar with where they make a difference but it looks like an intentional special mac case see macmessages and canshowmacsheetpanel i suspect this works fine after the general ui is up and running and that the problem here is a side effect of being the first frame
374,that being said the protocol explicitly state it to be two bytes EMO_POS
375,i dont understand why this is in its own scope it just causes all of the code to be indented further for no particular benefit
376,would go for template arguments inputindextype which could be by default indexvaluetype or unsigned int and dimension
377,i realized late last night that it probably didnt make sense to specify the damage using frects since the damage is defined on pixel boundaries i was originally thinking frect because sourcecrop is a frect but thats not exactly analagous i think this should be hwc_rect_t that probably implies that we should use hwc_region_t except that size_t is way overkill and will eat another bytes in relative to this since were currently getting the uint32_t for free because of padding
378,implementing the test with existing key then acquiring relevant to be continued
379,correct one is according to jamesf wiki instead of index.php hes fixing it up on the server
380,set i would prefer that you didnt submit this i agree with the first reviewer turning the condition around will make it better readable besides that great idea and solution
381,need for provider here inject flushcashe directly both postcaches flushcache are singletons so the provider hurts more than it helps here e g on line it get called in a loop and returns allways the same singleton instance
382,my comment regarding this in previous patch sets
383,errno as the third param and remove the component
384,was only referenced from the description text in restapiaccounts.txt which is deleted by this change since the json entities of the rest endpoints are described directly in the rest api documentation ive moved the description of the querylimit over to restapiaccounts.txt
385,because this file and this macro is also used from plain c code which only accepts this form of casting adding ifdefs just for this purpose does not seem useful
386,hides preference and makes it unavailable i think that fetching it if exists and appending to a new preference is better
387,now that this is an attribute of the campaign not an action we need to change the i18n string to archived
388,still cant decide whether this belongs here or in this applies to every romstage.c in this changeset
389,theory of this test count goes to zero because the delegates go far enough out of bounds to be destroyed but because of the easing formula you have to flick harder to make them go that far out of bounds now
390,i used that in other places youre right it doesnt make much of a difference no difference for norm and about or for the language tables ive simplified the code and also now use newformattedfilewriter in all the other places where im used before see the diff of to see how it is affected will first do the iana update separately unfortunately this increases the diff a lot again in but you can verify the data itself didnt change by looking at the checksum at the bottom
391,all tng constants in the header are prefixed with tng i think it could be nice to just call this variable api_version and then use tng_api_version in tng_io.cpp and switch the names in version.h.in
392,will be used by the ui from a query when suggesting autocompletion of all existing labels
393,move this to getstringmethod and rename getstringmethod to getstringmethodoverload
394,tobias please include the file comment at the top USER_MENTION mahara USER_MENTION artefactmultirecipientnotification USER_MENTION david ballhausen tobias zeuch USER_MENTION URL gnu gpl version or later USER_MENTION for copyright information on mahara please see the readme file distributed with this software also please include die thanks ghada
395,do you set the value to true for the requiresauthentication here since it is already set when you create the class
396,method now only sends email i would change the name to reflect this fact
397,to write something along the lines of this is the number of sets of the most frequently written output type per frame set the best default will need some experimentation ideally this would be a userconfigurable option but it is not clear whether a hidden commandline option would be best or env var and not clear whether anybody would really use it in practice disk is cheaper than user compression time for the most part so well add a todo to reconsider for and not before
398,here toqt or just tovariant as it is taking a
399,set fails this already failed the unit tests once please do not submit any cls until the unit tests are fixed
400,extend ssh based acceptance test too
401,happens if this fails you have already deleted at the backend
402,as well drop the conditional and just assign it
403,value is having an abi compatible way to pass the proper information to ramstage from romstage theres no reason to allow something that can change to break in the future take for example the current different sizes of the previous space reserved in the cache_as_ram.inc files things that are brittle will break what is the bare minimum amount of info that needs to be passed isnt it just a bar and a couple of endpoints
404,it should be also fixed in qcryptographichash documentation
405,would ensure that ctx is not destroyed with the destruction of the USER_MENTION event
406,reason for not using constants from the enum if youll ever change the enum this tests will produce useless noise
407,the password hash from to you should probably run that idea past chris first
408,be better to move this test to right after the docio_read_doc_key_meta call since its doing the error handling for it if there was an error theres no point in populating doc and right
409,URL will help make the benchmark comparison more readable
410,removed this line in i1c2a5a9c3da5 with a commit message that noted you wanted com removal only in the second half of vv but there was no related change to how that worked how do we assess when you were right d
411,mainly tried declaring all variables in the localmost scope
412,unsigned int tdimension class t prefer a more descriptive name for the second template argument
413,to have variables as local as possible this helps with longterm maintenance for unsigned int for unsigned int
414,mock.patch.object also should be able to use the decorator like on the other method
415,dont see where we append the rewinded header to the database file otherwise when we open the db file next time it will still give us the latest header that is not rollbacked
416,merging these uncommon write barrier forms in to one function that takes flags i think theres a bug in the later atomic function fixes that this would help address
417,better way to do this is awk it suffers from less false positives on the id string and its more efficient
418,think columnname is a property that indicates a columns name im going more for which column should we extract from the file i thought about maybe columntouse im not sure because this configuration is going on a wiki page ill change it for clarity we can think about it more when we do the mediawiki change
419,to previous diff this is just moving the crop state from an swt button state to a flag in the wizard state object
420,there is a gerrit issue for this bug can you please add a reference to this bug as footer bug issue URL
421,only need instanceof type the rest will break gwt test for the cases where there is no metadata available
422,although this filter is specialized for only
423,were trying to make this documentation more consistent with other module pages then i assume this page is meant to be similar to URL in terms of listing the types provided by the module so we should add a list here that link to the following types component qtobject binding connections timer as these are the types provided by the qtqml module
424,i confused or will this get the above error invalid host name cant determine language does it need to be in an other else if
425,doesnt do any correctness tests of the file while a start that they exist i could just be touching files
426,findsubclasses would be a better name for these methods
427,alright fair enough most of the code ive seen uses mw.msg though
428,yes ok romcc and all that i forgot about that jazz on further thought w.r.t the naming it should really be pcidev_t no that would be typedefd to unsigned int used in struct pci_path that name would be clearer or are we doing to try and encode all different types of devices into a simple_device_t
429,removed this in patch set my use case should be handled in the abstract controller
430,not sure why it was using a string there thanks
431,we set under such case then subsequent layout processing can be ignored
432,total bytes of addrs should be greater than size
433,parameter p_info p_info pinfo
434,meant the nodename of the element so that the path would become e.g can be postponed for later
435,proto_tree_add_item last argument is encoding no value
436,am sorry i just missed it before errno should already be set to enoent if fails we shouldnt map any other genuine errors to enoent
437,i see EMO_POS im not seeing an isempty method for the cursor class should i check for movetofirst false instead also while im on this is there a reason we call the cursorloader parameter cursorloaderloader and the cursor parameter cursorloader can i change them to just cursorloader and cursor
438,should be sufficient a commit can only have one author
439,made this info as restore being a not so common operation this log wouldnt be quite frequent and also its good to know why and who stopped bricks in these cases for debugging later coz most customer setups dont run in debug mode
440,we dont have all functions available in cluster.rc volinfo_filed get_quotad_count so on
441,and would it actually be process nested group objects help needed
442,have tested this race using gdb as result i commented below code here we are just stopping new threads we are not destroying rpc resource there might be already running threads which may be try to request and reply after rpc and uds stop in this scenario i was getting error from rpc layer i dint see any seg fault i will try to do some more tests in this race condition
443,look at URL i suggest you setup api checks they give a lot of warnings here about missing USER_MENTION tags etc
444,is unnecessary only mwextensioninspector uses nodemodel
445,print but not errant and commented out i got tired of putting back every time i came to this routine
446,of now some caller assumes that the returned ref is not nil when the returned err is nil when this assumption is not valid as the original code shows subsequent actions on the returned ref would cause npe and lead to goxdcr crashes which caused the issue in mb18266 returning a metadatanotfound err here is more correct conceptually since this code is called from query apis for remote cluster refs and not being able to find the ref is an error condition it will result in more consistent and predictable behavior the aforementioned issue will no longer occur
447,the function pass the device also into the function
448,cd returns bool i dont think absolutepath is a valid method call on bool
449,we removed prelinking for a very specific reason security and i dont think we want to put it back in the platform
450,ask the maintainer to commit the change on the authors behalf
451,using expert_add_info and use the returned from hf_ath_hlen so that the hlen field that is bad is highlighted
452,the array is actually only used in one case im not sure that makes sense added a comment instead
453,be new right
454,bucket needs to have its own gen to avoid sharing with other buckets
455,can we have processes calling into a bufferqueue or viceversa the process would be calling in to a different bufferqueue right
456,it seems my comment isnt quite correct windows has and it behaves like you would expect for the c library the windows api calls essentially have their own errno that is retrieved by getlasterror and these error codes are not the same as those used by errno and thus use the gross api formatmessage URL instead im not actually sure what to do with the logging api here given that windows actually needs two plogs ill update the comment either way
457,is quite sneaky this doesnt cover for example youll still be attached to the old window but given that this code shouldnt change too much in the future calling updatewindow in all different isnt going to break less so anyway
458,variables are only used in the next call id remove them
459,having doxygen documentation for the defines will generate warnings when merged to master
460,think thats just a mistake in make.bash its better to fail fast and minimize distractions to stderr when you know youve already lost id say add an exit failure here and then submit if you feel strongly about keeping it asis you can submit this too and we can fix them both later if we decide to
461,see you are calling the same twice it looks like this can be simplified to if for institution admins is_institute_admin
462,use instead to also get the intended behavior for multivalued attributes and unsets
463,should also be converted gf_validate_or_goto take this as global comment
464,dont think the comparison with the sshcommands or restviews is fair for ssh commands we have a simple lookup by command name and it is all that matters for project rename tasks it may be and probably is critical in which order the steps are executed it is not just a set of tasks that can be done in any order for a critical command as project rename the order of tasks execution should be explicit at least it has to be documented right now one has to look in the taskmodule then in the dynamicset and find out that internally it stores its items in a list which means that the iterator will iterate in the order of the elements as they are in this list and this is not even behavior of the dynamicset
465,not needed any more spaces should be created by t3skin itself
466,check is improved in URL
467,changes i just flipped the ifs but i just see that theres still the skipsystemdependencycheck stuff in it
468,will work on the object containing tolerances for both precisions with the helper functions intended to be the main way to construct them
469,think you really want a pthread_once_t here instead unless im misunderstanding what youre trying to do
470,lg_msg_rbthash_insert_failed
471,should better be moved to a signal in iwizardfactory then i suppose but different patch
472,says parameters of which have to be given and are optional if the function expects it should be you can check in the function wizard it is displayed
473,isnt c stop comparing it with c what you are doing here with the brightness is just redefining the same thing both boards you touched have the same definitions for the brightness and so it makes limited sense to redefine them as something interim
474,parameter pinfo
475,have the feeling that we should perhaps split the functionality here and use a separate enum for opencl which would indicate the forking point if a future ocl device needs different cluster size perhaps an overkill now but it would not hurt
476,probably better to include this line in a block to avoid inadvertent errors while making any changes around this code block as well as to make the code clearer to understand
477,lnet_ping EMO_NEG check that tmpid doesnt leak information struct has a hole after pid
478,add the tab sad that the latest clean up patches for the butterfly were not adapted
479,nstlist is not affected by this change it will still change nstlist or do you mean to add a note even with is explained as guess and with seems ok to me
480,size is not the issue and performance is not a big deal like in test please use range to mainatain future compat with python3
481,probably also mention the the optimizer scale estmation was pushed into the parent class
482,agree with the above comment the above logic change should be in a separate patch than the channel handling
483,entire code above this comment can be deleted as long as the dp node.data.parsoid is fixed to set it to when node.data or node.data.parsoid is missing
484,you are currently on you wont see the message this only appears only when coming from or earlier
485,convention here is to have url like this
486,chance vds is null lets say vds moved to error then user remove it from system will this timer still trigger
487,set looks good to me approved lgtm and yes please do upstream
488,need someone with some maven experience to review this
489,i understand this right the buildr process is able to load java classes dynamically and invoke them with reflection that does it make it slightly easier to do some complex steps
490,to check for values and use second in that case
491,to as the assertion is there for mostly documentation purposes
492,is the same as in the underlying os calls and this same construct is also used in the nbsearch pair loop as it minimizes the amount of code the caller needs to write for correct looping and is quite easy to implement as theres only one function that returns something
493,is possible to kept alcatellucent.xylan and remove the other xylan has buy by alcatel in if i remember
494,this something like you have no posts tagged and put in the changed in the tpl file
495,actually look at what i just merged to master with the query operators in particular you might want to read the documentation in usersearch.txt you can write a query to identify changes that can be submitted verified1 codereview2 if we put that string minus the part that would be implied into your field it means what you want it to mean you can submit this only if the above expression is true by making it a single string all you need to do is feed the string from the table through the changequerybuilder to get a and then run match on that to see if the submit is possible that completely removes the functionstate mess and starts to move us into this configurable submit logic that we have been discussing for quite a long time so the existence of that changequerybuilder and its predicate support classes is why i was trying to steer you into a simple string here we have the code already done to handle that as a string and users can use the same syntax to search for changes as they can for controlling how we manage them
496,USER_MENTION i will do it separated blueprint thanks
497,remember url was the suggested one but url class itself was all upper case so i was in between im changing it to fromurl
498,thought a little about this basically it should work like this imagename is null theres no friendly name for the image use the imageid to the image imagename is not null theres a friendly name specified for the image but since it can be duplicated its not guaranteed to be unique then we should also give an hint about which image it is at the moment thats done reporting the initial part of imageid just as git does with short hashes now considering this last case if we set imagename imageid then the displayed name would be something like myisoimagename.iso myisoim please let me know if you have a better idea on how to handle this all anyway beside the image name displaying i think that the safest way to address this now is not to set an imagename since in fact theres not an additional friendly name to set
499,need for the above the commit log diff etc provides info about the change
500,edwin thank you to have a look i removed them because current version of projectstable already has these lines content i test this feature and find k j o can work with or without this feature enter hot key can not work we can test by URL i ever try to only add keycodes.key_enter util.c.projectlistopen but gerrit feels not happy and give a running time error URL i guess its a bug at some corner of gerrit
501,annoying even more as i in postrouting is already used in external_gateway_nat_rules l1468
502,quite contrary to cases where the string is only compared or appended to nonempty in which case qlatin1string is more efficient
503,dont get it you do not have the same keys here and in the rpmbased part wed like this to be a portability layer so that engine should not care if its rpm or deb maybe the mapping is impossible but it does not seem that theres an attempt here
504,think it is if you read the documentation of whats happening when theres already a conversion registered the new conversion function is getting deleted i.e nothing will happen one could of course remove the old converter but that would be bad if a conversion is happening at the same time in another thread therefore its the same kind of warning as in e.g
505,happens if match is missing or empty does it do something sensible when trying to match against an empty pattern or should such commentlink rules be skipped e.g with a continue statement here
506,think that this should be removed and and needs to be incremented by instead see other comments below
507,this call free or just remove free and put that code in here
508,a vdsm.config.config clone modified by tunables tunables is a list of section key val tuples
509,i have a white background so i didnt catch the yellow highlight thanks
510,dont line inline styles can this be done in css
511,is still spread a lot across the core this will be a seperate task to clean this up this makes it only more easy to find
512,dont think config can be null so now you can drop the method EMO_POS
513,so it is recommended that it not block
514,werror_common_flags note guard by
515,see i can probably help you with that i would like to assert that if have_usbdebug is available the chipset mainboard does the setup in bootblock to get things at least halfway working that or so early in romstage it is before console i think that is a good goal to have
516,its racy it should be guarded optimally with a lock that is not so global but then youre talking about improvements that are in the nanosec granularity
517,above code from is present in the so therefore existed before the so needs to be removed
518,it free the allocated memory here and return null if mkstemp fails
519,this is strange ok we succeeded in authn but have not yet authz so we cannot report it here we should report only after we have all information where do we do authz in this case
520,about that one is it because you wont be able to automatically change call sites
521,thanx i actually did not know that it was possible like code review for team learning EMO_POS will fix in the next patchset
522,the transition to orm all we should care of is the real identifiers of this class which is id thats considered to be not true since least i dont do not know yet which operations will be performed on entities we cannot tell what we have to compare namely we have to know first whether these entities will be processed also with unset id when stored in collections if so then comparing just ids spells crazy results usually its recommended to compare some unique business id instead of or along with db id see hibernate recommendation related to id generation object identity ok ill regenerate using these two fields note this syntax is java7 syntax with direct field access allowing comparing classes with their descendants the last thing is necessary due to hibernate design
523,line ought to use the variable to say token a token previously acquired with
524,this is correct the error was introduced by bbc94edb9a91b27910d43610db994df10dd99e1
525,also mention that it builds the method lists inside the jmethod instances
526,i call getmatrix having called setdataframeobject add a bried usage description here
527,conditional is always true so it should be removed as confusing
528,exiting the loop doesnt do a final update of v the write to conflict with this read must happen during the setup for a subsequent iteration this one does bother me to be clear whats going on is v go func x v v go func y v there is no race involving the second goroutine since its read is guaranteed to happen after the write of v the race is between the x v and the v i dont understand why the race detector does not detect that misordering of the time i filed about this at least this fixes the build so that we can detect future breakages while dmitriy thinks about this one
529,i need a way to tell whether the newestconfiguration is enabled since the returned by defaultconfiguration does not mean that instead it means there are no configurations at all how else do you suggest i could expose it
530,that this means envp is empty while you fill in ld_library_path path and tmpdir in the gomobile code im not sure how to get the environment or if its even necessary all the go environment functions in runtime assume that go has already been somewhat initialized
531,macro vkey_features_inode_quota and vkey_features_quota
532,wonder if eventually we should put these in the file table as well EMO_POS not in this change though
533,set looks good to me but someone else must approve inline comments lgtm with a couple of small optional suggestions i agree that using more realistic sites to consume memory would be nice but i think getting something up and running soon would be valuable as well
534,i still dont like these ternery operators used as statements i would prefer using an if statement
535,method does not what the name says it should just be named updatecommitbuttons and take a boolean so you can use this in another place too
536,think that this could really happened because ptlrpc has single thread for rq_set that means only one ptlrpc_check_set could happened for a request and ptl_send_rpc could not race with after_reply
537,is not following the style for the other source files
538,error unused parameter data void use to set unused parameter
539,this probably doesnt always work booleans are stored as with value y for true and n for false not every jdbc driver out is going to grok this as a boolean value it would be safer to use in code such as this cant this statement also be written as an update update accounts set reverse_patch_set_order y where display_patch_sets_in_reverse_order y update accounts set show_username_in_review_category y where display_person_name_in_review_category y this should be much faster to process and every sql server we support will grok those two small statements and it avoids the problem with boolean conversion
540,it possible to put this init function inside the nehalem romstage or are there any problems
541,they need some more tweaking to supports booth modes standalone and in tree
542,here not but instead v vr compare with betadist and betainv
543,will add an new everytime i change the switch please add the code to make sure only one is appended
544,use import for java.util.arrays instead using explicitly here
545,file now has windows line endings USER_MENTION could you verify that you have configured in your tycho repository clone
546,this special case it did not exist before and all it callers seem to take it from a tvb except for a hardcoded in enhancedalarmmessage which seems wrong too as the length is not checked there
547,replace the whole thing with platform.linux_distribution
548,i found an abandoned change in gerrit from where stefan commented this ich7 i945 pmbase is already set in romstage please drop if code guess that justifies a comment so it is clear when comparing from different pchs URL
549,rather do the logging fix separately and not in to avoid the potential to miss any warnings we can add a warning in the release note to not run the upgrade in batch mode
550,put code snippets into double back ticks in order to highlight them in the changelog
551,ironed out the issues on bug a few patches are linked from it
552,two methods are business logic so they dont belong in the api they should be part of the addvm command so that the same logic is used when using the api or the gui
553,think it might be worth a comment up here what this class is intended to do and how it does it
554,is no need for a continue here since it means the same as the normal program flow
555,could use dont delete the list_del_init which is on a different list
556,the commentpopupdialog.geteditable check
557,all link is a link that is js controlled is follow the right word to use here
558,a suggestion may be we can pass both channels as arguments
559,is no need to reference its an object
560,would add a new variable with the tag name this will make it so you can show which tags dont have any results
561,set i would prefer that you didnt submit this seems like you commited some too much EMO_POS
562,itkassertindebugandignoreinreleasemacro for efficiency
563,thought of making it public bcoz i had thought of making a itextpdf library wrapper that can be used to export any reports in future.like this class doesnt dictate any specific layout and provides methods to create the layout elements of choice although it currently provides only a small number of layout elements like
564,are two cases to be covered when the tokens are empty this is the one you did also when you do have comment token but the offset is its begin
565,use logs instead of system.out you can add a log4j configuration to redirect to stdout if you want to see these printings
566,logic to check for checkpoint restart was added in release51 but in master we changed the name to startingfromcheckpoint
567,started replacing c0 with because i didnt see a significant advantage of having c0 available but then i saw this and realized this ai naming is used in some other places and it might be helpful to have the i m index i thought about creating an enum to define i to m to use as but of course i to m would be by itself bad names which conflict easily with other things and i thought it would be nice to have c and a by consistent so i also created co c2 not just ai am i think consistency with the previous name is more important than consistency to the variable name but it doesnt really matter to me
568,not entirely sure this will work ill have to give this a test
569,sqlite the only db option to use ganesha what about mysql sqlite is usually not used in production im just wondering why theres such limitation here
570,line will also call sorry i try every corner and cannot find the difference after adding this line
571,which case shouldnt the code just say that all other open projects should already have their sdks pointing to the sdk used by the ide i.e now that we do this we shouldnt have to modify other projects only this project since all others should already be in sync the fishy part here is just that choosing something in a project import dialog affects other projects which doesnt make sense if you want that experience then the dialog should be more of a global ide preference
572,need for indirection here merge benchmarktcpconcurrentreadwrite into this function and use the addr directly
573,some reason i thought that the overflow behavior was unnecessary now i see that it is used in case of multiple dexes i reverted the change
574,assume here that size of phdr entry is sizeof you should use phentsize instead
575,coreboot maybe you could insert accesswidth8 before the if to ensure that coreboot users arent tripped up im the first guy to discourage unnecessary changes to vendorcode but this code is broken and we should somehow warn users about it it would be even better if we could make the code fail by static analysis instead of a runtime assert
576,out is extra here you can use num_rebalance everywhere
577,need to test both nonprivileged udp4 and privileged ip4 sockets here
578,could probably be determined dynamically at build time but not in this patch
579,should be else rv in this case the lcb_cntl user will get correct effective type
580,the config callback sufficient it sounds tricky that a returned config is valid only until the config callback is called if possible i prefer limiting the configs life inside the config callback and letting users maintain a copy of some info based on need
581,while writing the function ive also unpacked it from the current oneline version into a lengthier but more easily read equivalent using ifelse
582,the trailing slash already removed when the github url was read from the config
583,this into a deps variable and reuse the value above in gwt_module too
584,guessing but if multiple loops act on the same vector and that vector exceeds a cache level then you can do slightly better by alternating the order of loop traversal so that you do reuse what you do have in cache
585,an invalid object size limit results in displaying an internal server error if possible it should display a proper error message saying that the limit is invalid
586,is bogus for ios now both withdarwinssl and withnss are set
587,think you also need to add to this that number comes from the fulltextsearch left and right margins otherwise there is a horizontal scroll on the page
588,is a special and important message may be use something like p_msg_stale_handle_remove_failed here
589,it is just moved disregard the comment on v1
590,need to do error detection etc perhaps its easier to just build up a single buffer and then call a single function to write everything to disk so that you have a single place to add file io error detection and logging
591,thought the point of the platform file is to make it easier by requiring only one option of course the user can also simply use if i dont specify the compiler then whats the point of having a platform file at all im pretty sure gcc will never support the mic vector instructions compiling with gcc works but is of course useless without the vector instructions and it seems also very unlikely that clang will ever support it
592,would require to change diskimageguid member to static as well
593,these data representative of the inputs that the function receives afaict youre not storing individual collections in subpages
594,also this method shows a lot of in the code inspector unused variables etc but i find it hard to refactor this atm
595,log methods now do make use of the instance variables accountcache groupcache groupbackend
596,bucket name cannot contain symbols from html that is why i remove escaping
597,is problematic because you know you have go code passing a go pointer into c maybe you had that before and i didnt notice i dont think we should put code like that in our examples
598,wonder why checkstyle did not complain here this time
599,this field will occupy bytes for our bit builds no matter what due to alignment for the next variable
600,means the folder structure is not as expected i guess we had always as follows
601,can remove the access tag and set the function actually to private
602,about to change above line like below gt.client git checkout b newbranch
603,as mentioned elsewhere the polling wait is likely unnecessary in the opencl implementation
604,the suggested while loop this would become i
605,dont understand the problem without the explicit assign and copy operator and without the implpointer not needed if the setmode is done easier i dont see why it wouldnt just work by itself correctly with gmx_unique_ptr sorry if im miss something obvious
606,say yes i mean why not have hex for your file sizes internally EMO_POS
607,is a matter not related with this commit but shouldnt be an optimization if we replace with instead of so as we save some bytes in final js we should consider edge cases like in js objects etc though
608,it confirmed with ui team to use this distinction
609,consistent about inner class references here you use metadata but above you use securestoreloadutil.metadata in this case i am ok with either form in the class but want them to be consistent within the lines of code you have
610,is a bit more information provided by do we want to have it as part of an event
611,think ill cherrypick rebase and add the bootblock.elf and coreboot.ram fixes in makefile halfbaked output
612,nopcode have of course to be efacopcode then
613,this runnable needs to run after the previous ones onsuccess
614,to signature relevant files are so depending on the signing algorithm used you may have to also exclude URL
615,think the copyright is eike stepper berlin germany and others
616,displays the opening curly brace but not the closing one is that intentional
617,is the reason for having them private i mean i usually like private stuff but its uncommon in typo3 cms EMO_POS
618,my opinion a distinction needs to be drawn between ipv6 header bogus length and extension header bogus length whether all the different extension header should use the same expert_field or not for length is another issue its debatable but my current opinion is that they should be separate i.e ei_ipv6_routing_invalid_length ei_ipv6_dstopts_invalid_length etc but if someone thinks differently please share
619,this be all of the groups and not just controllers
620,usually stands for development tool see e.g URL
621,be a local typedef in the single function that uses it
622,you clarify what is meant by listbox prenotify that doesnt make things any clearer
623,doxygen documentation will also be a bit better if you add arrayref to these functions and similarly for the constarrayref ones
624,still think you also need to check that the is allowed for for example if i alter an internal media block to have the artefactid point to an image artefact i get this match image image file file so they are not seen as mismatched but internalmedia so they should be mismatched as an internalmedia block cant have an image as its artefact so we need to check not just if the plugin is correct eg file but that the artefacttype is of the correct subset for the block eg audio video for the block instance eg internalmedia
625,is a refactoring from my side that sneaked in when i split the commit ill revert this asap since it adds nothing to this change
626,do will have to swap the mechanisms of how it works from false to true and set the default to true ie device detection enabled
627,after all it wouldnt fail the test because this thread will still do the below which is the only thing that is checked a bit flaky imo but it should work in the meantime
628,any output provided by a successful command
629,set thanks for your reviews to be honest it would be nice if you could be a bit more friendly to not first time in case of thomas but occasional contributors imho one or two are enough for the beginning bjrn and philipp youre really helpful contributors thanks for that we were discussing the patch for a patch rule over the last days which we enjoined on ourselves as core team members some time ago and it works in at least most of the cases i think please dont treat this as harsh words i just want to make you aware of the fact that motivating every new contributor is very important for us and hopefully also for you as an essential part of the typo3 community thanks for your support steffen p.s the reason why jenkins fails is probably because of the parent commit is very old and the patch has to be rebased will try to get this done now if network connection allows
630,note that what i write is not real and reciprocal space below the cutoff we have both the real space and reciprocal space contribution
631,to check ahead and simply log the fact that we will not overwrite files
632,nigel to expand on what tobias said when you change the content of a language string you also need to change its name otherwise the launchpad translation site isnt smart enough to tell translators that they need to update it see URL so please change the string name to editaccesspagedescription4 youll also need to change the name of the string in the php files and templates where it is used sorry about that cheers aaron
633,parameter p_info p_info pinfo
634,is a logical change but it is correct null triggers a php notice when is not set
635,a lot for your review what do you think about in the adapted class anyway im going to bother some of the guru to hear what they think about it
636,is determined which of the opcodes is actually taken during import of i think thats missing note that now that we use rid_strlist_function_names_english_ooxml with the formula compiler the tables in are only provided for api support of which we actually dont know if anyone is using it at all our internal ooxml doesnt use them anymore so any only for import only for export usage needs to be implemented differently
637,dont see my comment in utils.py configure the logger with proper formatter instead
638,have been told in the past some compilers dont initialize all elements to with ive never found such a compiler so maybe its an urban legend EMO_POS memset yup shoulda done that ironically i looked for a memset equivalent in glib so i dont know why i didnt use it
639,are good but i think we need another test which exercises the untested path in fault.py otherwise if it is in fact unreachable we need to eliminate that code path
640,yeah will be removed with next push
641,i mean line y lineheight gc display
642,this need to be public can we have a short doc comment
643,wouldnt bother with bufio.newreader just read bytes or something rather than bothering with readstring
644,to in this scope to indicate that we consider it private in this scope otherwise initpropertyproviders
645,documentation here is pretty much the same but the errors occur in different circumstances
646,addsdrobject method test goes into infinite loop because there is already addsdrobject function with same parameter which is mandatory in both cases so should i add new method in parent class
647,on the same line yeah its probably on the one below
648,think we should replace this by getbyseverity to avoid juggling with message types in userland
649,was mentioning the blank line please dont remove tk.withextra
650,variable you should probably use here is u_boot_fdt_use defined in make.conf i agree the name is not great we can change it if you like but the intention is that this variable tells you which fdt to use so there should be no need for this sort of logic in ebuilds
651,you factor the whole function out into reboot_service_impl so we dont need to gotos
652,just feels wrong the test setup code should not be writing to the notedb separately there should be a method in patchlinecommentsutil that writes to the appropriate based on the config
653,comment as above for shift shift shift nibbitswidth
654,the final commit remove and join the odff function fdist to the first summary line
655,or long underlying ssize_t types should be ok to return this
656,generally prefer not to be credited in source files
657,what we are using is oslo version i think this should be fixed in oslo i submitted a patch to oslo URL
658,have no idea what this means but this is probably not the place to fix it
659,i had changed this routine to start from one less than the value passed but forgot to change br_init_children if you check fini it correctly passes ill fix this although its ok not to change this as this routine is executed when the process in tearing down so its probably doesnt matter much
660,please use tab in each line following the coreboot coding standard
661,should use a different filter name as you cannot mix ft_uint64 hf_glusterfs_size64 and ft_uint32 hf_glusterfs_size see chapter
662,seems clearer to return here and let the caller set the variable a better name would be something like startaddingentrytocache since the postcondition is that when it returns the task is scheduled assuming the persistent unit cache is running at all
663,also need to check the return value from wal_commit as well
664,but its impact is pretty minimal so i wouldnt worry about it
665,mast be set to time on vm domdependent or else we would never report powering_up
666,the changecontrol instance instead of loading the change again
667,you are right although i do not believe we ever did EMO_POS ill change it back
668,i will comment and revise this function sorry for the confusion
669,is not necessary the same array can be used as multiple things without any problems just make sure that code handles it correctly dont forget to update the documentation in the header
670,in some places function returns something then it should return always something
671,some info about the purpose selecting node position
672,error for the operation if there is no error this value will evaluate to
673,size here is now just the size of the struct hence the names will not be a part of the dict further dict_set_bin takes in a pointer that it strores in the and later is freed when this dict is destroyed in the case of passing a pointer which is a structure containing another pointer the dict routines cannot encode this into the dict overall as info is passed to be stored as a dict the above mechanism of allocating a pointer within info and passing this would fail to send these values across and also leak memory for the allocated
674,should be i believe the empty username is a valid name
675,structure is in packet scope is this normal to allocate in file scope and no need to set it to you are assigning it the line below
676,this would make the change smaller as you dont need to make it a member function
677,youre probably referring to the idea of returning the normalized location of the face instead of the absolute coordinates in pixels i think we can take care of this in a subsequent patch and its not immediately clear whether it will simpli
678,customcontext_hybristexture is defined for sure here
679,can simply use here it is initialized in the bootstrap basically this global does not need initialization and extension could still use it in ext_tables and ext_localconf
680,seems to me that this operation is not optimal as it would try to find a number in a list while you only need to check it against boundaries
681,it doesnt we just have to parse repohooks childnodes after the project childnodes which you already do above EMO_POS
682,i think initlinemodel should be noop too the semantics of it are what happens when a different key is picked but in this case nothing should change when a different key is picked right both value boxes constrained value and free text are hidden all along so i would hide them originally say by extending the createnewlinemodel method and implement this as noop
683,got an exception expecting eof found
684,if this message could be more descriptive in terms of specifying what remote operation failed
685,we will need to get this repo setup and populated before these changes are approved and applied on any hosts can anyone confirm if i have guessed an appropriate name for the repository
686,according to last changes related to tvb_captured_length and tvb_reported_length it is good point to start thinking about reported case btsnoop format provide both frame length in reported case we can have only part of frame for example first bytes this dissector will fail at this line so nothing will be dissected but if you move lines directly before place when it will be use then we can dissect some fields context can be filled somewhere about line current rf_channel can be put between lines aa_offenses can be fetch after or where context is filled the problem is flags but after moved it after line you are able to decode btle_rf_channel field etc
687,think it should be since the methods which are last modified by deadcodeelimination are deadcodefree another concern is that when it is called by methodinliner actually we want to traverse the methods that modified by methodinliner not all the modified methods since last deadcodeelimination the result would be the same but it may do unnecessary work in methodinliner
688,count already there please remove this from your code
689,agree with erik the message is an nonissue and can stay as is i was just curious about the plan to merge the other two commits but even that doesnt really matter
690,use here so the code is more consistent
691,not and cant be same as with proto fields that this code is a copy of and quite a few other preexisting lua code spots too for that matter
692,unfortunately boardspecific modifications to agesawrapper.c files have leaked in making this a long boring process
693,a blind re.replace on an xml is a bug waiting to happen the xml has structure and it is safer to use it please parse the xml and replace only the element you expect unless of course you have a particular intention here
694,rather looks like an illegalargumentexception looks like we should check this earlier when seturi is called and already fail there if a uri is already set
695,space should be removed per previous comment
696,set fails USER_MENTION really nice ui changes and the image gui has improved a lot one thins thou when trying to hide and element on a page which not has been published an exception is thrown maybe something that should be handled inside the php code instead
697,using this many parameters using named parameters is preferable to make things more clear
698,it doesnt explode i am not changing a sebool i am changing the file context yes a restorecon would undo the change well need to file a request for that but for now this is good enough
699,convert inbetween line to tabs maybe consider converting the whole function to tabs
700,the string is boxed ie if the string is created in javascript new string it is no longer acts like java.lang.string in gwt lang for example aboxedjsstring instanceof string will return false
701,is returning a guint whats the intent of value are there cases where we cannot find the dnp header immediately
702,sounds similar can that be used instead if you add a new msgid glfs_dht_num_messages needs to be updated
703,are mixing two different use cases use case begintransaction commit this works because begintransaction set and commit is successful even though nothing to commit use case open connection with commit evidently this doesnt work on all jdbc dialects supported by gerrit e g this doesnt work on postgresql for the same reason why rollback doesnt work to see the failure remove this ifguard above and run postgresql unit test testrollbacknotransaction it is failing with cannot commit when autocommit is enabled or some such
704,be you could add a comment where these constants are coming from
705,incorrect spacing gets fixed here URL
706,there a selector you can use with so this doesnt look so godawfully clumsy
707,assume that the reason that the copyright is updated now is because the file was updated in but the copyright wasnt
708,about use default wikitext namespace see getdefaultwikitextns below or allow specifying namespace as an argument
709,remove it here but so you know theres a problem if someone sets it to null for example from rest it fails with npe in storagecomandbase but that can be fixed in a different patch
710,this one stuck out i think the only ones to try to capitalize are allocation type element since that trio is the dominant set of apis for interacting with any sort of data from java
711,it seems to be line that is indented wrong the newly added lines are correctly indented inside the tag
712,i understand what youre trying to do here my concern is that we change the state from backfill to in_memory even if there are backfill items in the queue or unacked items in the ack queue that we will implement soon this will cause some confusions in debugging showing stats in ui etc lets add this to the todo list and address it as a separate commit
713,at least not visually p the following section is in the same green box unlike other style guides that put it in a red box section of discouraged cases
714,seems that you changed the behavior when there is an overflow the data of constantmanager are not longer corrected thus it is not possible trying to merge a smaller dex file which does not overflow could you upload a separate cl that remove only this feature with figures to see if there is benefits perhaps you had some problems with it for parallel dex merging or you think that it was not useful
715,string needs to be changed this does not return anything it can be something like this function verify detail of referenced datastore
716,to prefix and further down in the code too i had it mostly coded with date serial numbers but had to make functions that are available for class date i could only find appropiate date serial number functions in the module a module that i would rather move entirely to the normal calc function module once the excelanalysisaddin can be considered obsolete imho that would reduce the complexity of the calcfunction code i will peg date to date serial number conversion as a todo item on my lotask stack
717,instead should be const pparseend because expects sal_unicode const pparsedend at that place code probably shouldnt even compile like it is
718,dont think it needs to be set which means it doesnt need to be in the input
719,the patchset.id is required here so is a better approach
720,be was ie10 as of the member var above i think changing the member to edge is not a problem but i would keep the ie8 default here which does not hurt us and will also not hurt third party stuff then
721,are these two arguments joined together into the target string or maybe these should be passed asis and let the xml rpc server join them together
722,discussed change it to if ret mismatch break
723,removing those checks in the other modules too this is the new way
724,gregor need to make this accessible by adding with relevant details to labels also add spans for hidden text anchors with spans buttons need to have alt text etc please refer to URL for more details thanks ghada
725,will change it there was a debate about whether we should also check for false false etc which is why it was a list i left it like that in case we changed our minds provided we dont ill just make it a simple equality check
726,the right path in EMO_POS
727,this be subject to the same bug if the server answers something different for one of the keys like temp_fail what about doing a response.read while its not returning socket.isalive false the noop already returns from the loop but the case where correlationid doesnt map to a key should maybe also be a break from the loop not a continue
728,pick a different name to avoid a collision with the field of the same name in main
729,commit amend and everything up until the last changeid line can be removed
730,dont need this line any more or we could keep this here and use it instead of calling parseint in the five instances below
731,did you add this back its not needed as far as i know
732,and it does i submitted an amendment with a better comment explaining that
733,move modeladaptersource into the d pointer and hide all the ipc api from the userfacing api here that would reduce this to take a qaim to remote and a name for it everything else can be internal
734,already bunch of strcpy calls scattered throughout this file anyways
735,a whole volfile path this way seems a bit fragile would it be possible to pass the flag and a path so that the receiver constructs the final path instead of the sender
736,this is not new code but docs are always good
737,the array is always allocated with new if own_arrays_ is true also delete nullptr is defined to be a nop
738,only worry here is that future c or assembly versions of memcmp16 might use x14 x15 i have used a more conservative approach in my tree ldo_memcmp16 save lr and return value if comparison equal stp x0 x30 setup args for mov x0 x2 uxtw x2 w3 bl restore lr and return value if comparison equal ldp x1 x30 if the strings are equal i.e x0 then return length comparison cmp x0 csel x0 x1 x0 eq ret end art_quick_string_compareto
739,do you think about my last paragraph do you think its really needed to have a parsedevmode and parseprodmode methods
740,im just mostly replicating the what is done when including css styled contents ts using the include static select to me your questions show you did not look at the issue can we please get this through apart from the above no there is not a filename and yes there needs to be a slash
741,defined here there is a USER_MENTION for this attribute to change it to visible as static
742,you also update release_notes.markdown in the project root you are adding interfaces it would be great to document them there
743,are nice tests can we put them on abstracthasdata directly instead of the table subclass the one bit that youd have to keep here would be the test with the alternative tablebuilder
744,other comment about oustring together with scresid just as short explanation the current code creates a schresid object which has an operator oustring which is called here then the oustring copy ctor is called to generate a copy from the returned oustring
745,think this needs to stay here the idea is to have valid notificationproperties we need a notification method currently smtp and later so it cant ba validates inside smtp
746,dont think this is the way we should do it the routine execute_x86cpuid is obviously and that is why it is only defined on certain x86 platforms for other platforms we should never call this routine but then we should add proper ifdefs around that call we will gradually get more detection routines so it does not make sense to have all routines available on all architectures but usually nonfunctional
747,change provides two options for clobber so the client can pass its own new rev id to couchdb or ask couchdb to generate a new rev id this code path corresponds to the second case so the flag and expiration values here will be overwritten by couchdb and you wont get them through your changes in mc_tap
748,using instead of another variable called zero
749,nonempty go into reverse mode where the buildlet dials the coordinator instead of listening for connections the value is a commaseparated list of modes e.g
750,gd_msg_volinfo_set_fail
751,cfs_list_add is deprecated use list_add instead
752,is inaccurate the code assumes stripe offset is set make sure stripe offset is in ost list
753,that means to also change comparisons with string_notfound which is defined to lastindexof returns if not found so the condition here can be simplified to if npos
754,mentioned that is good to have i will try to convert tests for distribute volume
755,code in this library was generated by emugen and then manually modified vi transformations to match this library need this code will be replaced with driver implementation
756,doesnt leave them it always removes them use specified directory for temporary files
757,in the end you dont even need the agesa struct you might think that casting to a struct makes the code more readable but in this case it also hides nasty bugs
758,given totalcount is guaranteed to be zero here just return zero its clearer to the reader whats being returned
759,put it here because i think it belongs to the apache site more than other places
760,should rename this method to artefact_title_for_view_and_block because what it really does is tell you if the artefact has an alternate title when viewed in a specific view block
761,is updates the avail size to max with this we are not getting the correct value in the below output avail size should be rootUSER_MENTION df h filesystem size used avail mounted on
762,fills the functionname opcode mapping from a list of text resources in rid_strlist_function_names in
763,the test doesnt install sg at all it will fall on the first run if sg is already installed on vm
764,might be used to americanisms here they can be awful sometimes they right things like this its garbage EMO_POS
765,looks like createmergeconflictinfo always shows the warning then adding the warning should be an implementation detail of createmergeconflictinfor and the mergeresult needs to be passed to it as a parameter
766,please and thank you d
767,is still available when this gets called so it can be safely passed to free_gpu the only inconvenience is that if mdrun crashes or gets killed the driver wont set the clocks back to the original values i guess this could be an rfe nvml could distinguish between admin and user access and tell the driver to set the clocks back after the application terminates
768,replace this stat with find type f in the for we will save a stat call
769,dont know that this will actually do what you want
770,have to dig a bit deeper into the blame history of this file to find out as we can see at line its being deliberately kept open rather than as an oversight if it needs fixing it can be done in a followup change
771,sql migrations requires it for work on the ec2 credential table
772,if the check is needed do you mind adding a comment about when this can be false
773,unused import java.lang.classcastexception
774,this to throw compileexception instead elsewhere on failure you throw ioexception or compileexception
775,see so ill leave it to go to but is it enough if our websocket proxy writes to syslog about i monkeypatched the methods that are used by old websockify to use logger what im worried about is the fact i see duplicate lines in syslog one line comes from journal the other one from ovirtwebsocketproxy and they are identical i need to investigate this further
776,wasnt paying enough attention to the context clearly the param is moved to the heap and instead assumed that if esc was not escheap that therefore it was not heap
777,set except for my spaces nitpicking yes EMO_POS
778,sure what our own script has to do with the annotation the export pragma could all be moved into the imp file if you prefer that this would leave us with only the keep for where we misusing the preprocessor as template language pme.c i think we should replace this anynow right now if one runs it on any of the files iwyu makes changes we dont want see the issues in the commit message but i dont see how that could be fixed by using a script to read the output it seems it would be easier to patch iwyu than replicating the headeranalysis in a postprocessing script
779,be more complete check for funcservice null first or use an optional
780,think we only support mysql sqlite and postgresql in the migrations mysql doesnt need this step because it stores indexes in a namespace per table this step is only necessary in postgres and sql because index names are in a dbglobal namespace
781,that this is a basic snapshot feature test we would like to keep the deactivate and activate snapshots to see that it doesnt bring things down and can happen in parallel the code that was removed was more of glusterd handshaking than volume snapshot feature
782,existing with uid
783,the spec says that the same format should be used for both critical options and extensions i named the structures optionstuple optionstuplevalue and optionstupleemptyvalue i believe i needed the latter to marshal extensions with empty values where there is no double length prefix starting at line of certs.go i used them in the marshaltuples and parsetuples regarding unmarshaling please take a look at the current version i wanted to use the same function for critical options and extensions and to handle properly empty and nonempty values i believe some lowlevel handling is needed i used an instance of optionstuplevalue structure to pass to unmarshal line
784,could probably be combined but the speed would be the same we still need to write the address out first before we can autoincrement lets leave that to later it gets moved to the southbridge wrapper
785,did not suggest that the functions would be called globally for all ni i said each time an interface that needs the acceptor if the interface doesnt use the acceptor dont call acquire at startup and dont call release at shutdown i dont much care about the length of the list or the time involved i am looking for code that is more easy to read and maintain
786,your users often link their books or publications to one online catalogue then you can set the url prefix here and they will only have to paste the book or publication id at the end of the url you must make sure that your url ends with a for example if your users need to link to publications in worldcat frequently set the url prefix to URL the the users only need to enter the publication id at the end of the url
787,guess it can be interpreted that its just being pointed out that this is a dependency not necessarily that its a new dependency and its good to have this documented
788,like the null should be dropped previously it was null for the attributes then evonne added
789,comment EMO_POS good idea ill update to explicitly call out canary_master it doesnt work initialize is mocked out in the sync_stage unit test so self.repo never gets initialized and is none in the conditional logic havent looked too far into why its not being triggered for masterrelease but i suspect that config simply doesnt run this unit test
790,remember seeing error like lproc attempting to register osc more than once when trying to mount lustre file system on server node looks like we have this logic to avoid recreating osc proc entry in osp_mod_init but its counterpart is missing in osc_setup so if we have osp loaded before osc we get the failure inserting osc module the error now gets hidden with this patch because lprocfs_seq_register only warns about it and creates duplicated entry in parents subdir link then subsequent lookup only finds the newly created entry and it can cause random failures
791,above lines repeats a bit and could go and be a function
792,not sure i understand your point here do you mean i should talk about things like field alignment and so on i think that mentioning java would make this more confusing
793,think initramfs and kernel image should be downloaded even if one of these files already exists otherwise we might end up with a version of a kernel different from that of the modules in initramfs
794,guess this specifies whether the file is an xvg file then i would suggest introducing an enumerated type instead both because we might have more file types to test in the future and because its is much more explicit with filetype_xvg than true as the last parameter in calls to this function alternatively isnt it possible to decipher the filetype from the extension
795,do we json_encode here we do not do this in the base class furthermore it is already serialized the only difference in this method compared to the one in the base class is now the tree.thisscript stuff the question therefore is is this a bug in the baseclass that tree.thisscript is not set or is it superfluous here if neither applies then still the question remains if theres a nicer way of adding this code snippet without overriding and copyiing the complete method from the base class
796,my opinion this function is not required arrayindexitems function can return one more array called counts count for each entry newsecondaryindexentry method can be added with one more arg count during index inser you just need to iterate through itms counts arrayindexitems and encode as
797,not clear if mean or if it means path to the project named gitilesparent when i changed the ondisk location via the rename above of my gitiles checkout under my directory to then i got to the next error EMO_POS
798,it would be better in a different tree it does need more documentation and testing for other applications
799,be tied to the wiki it was started from like the other global actions in my opinion
800,should be indented an additional spaces comapred to the begining of the function
801,http and accept no body this results in null being passed to the apply method which handles it gracefully by creating an empty input i think its common to call and with no input your tests are certainly showing that perhaps we should overload abandon and restore methods to also have a noarg form that passes null to apply the same way the http interface does when the client doesnt supply a body
802,a bit of a philosophical discussion i thought about it earlier but the reason for limiting the range is that we only use the single precision range in the simd parts of gromacs since all algorithms in particular need to work if the user has set the precision to single we only use double to improve precision not range one of course add double precision range tests but then the next obvious question is why we allow routines to provide incorrect results for nan negative zero etc and of course not to mention why we allow more than ulp error EMO_POS for the error functions i actually experimented a bit with only providing accurate results in a smallerthandoubleprecisionrange and this might still be a useful optimization strategy in the future thus i like the idea of merely testing what we actually need and if somebody comes up with a neat idea to improve that while only altering things we dont need that should fundamentally be a good
803,this variable name in docs is more important than conflicting with internal variable names data isnt much more descriptive than variable thing or stuff
804,must make sure the paste file is in absolute path mode config_path
805,miklos i have mentioned the relevant comments for this impacted ut in the commit message as well kindly have a look thanks
806,you noticed in your former review my patch originally allowed this by the presence of a msg_is_error flag that was passed to the callback john suggested we leave llapi_printf alone next patchset implements your suggestion with two distinct callbacks which i find clean flexible
807,ive changed this so that empty string will remove dependencies it felt most intuitive
808,swear i read somewhere on smashing magazine along time ago that all pseudo selectors are less performant but i cant find such an article i can only find these references not sure of there credibility EMO_NEG URL URL i think the main thing i would say is whilst integrating with ve we should avoid them where possible use of firstchild might invite us to use lastchild and other selectors based on the idea i do think we should be avoid nthoftype and nthchild at all costs but id expect firstchild and lastchild to be less evil that said browsers are getting better and better these days and we could just make the decision that we will use them and wait for browsers and ve to catch up as tech lead let me know what approach you want us to take happy either way please can we get the outcome documented on the coding guidelines page
809,shawn mentioned in another comment more occurrences below
810,why confusing otherwise to first time readers
811,to know id specify this in the doc i.e dont touch qobject
812,with a constant or use
813,dont understand why you need the boolean this should be new_rti.settop new_rti.setinexact
814,set alon regardless of discussion we have in the bug calling disconnect when sdk instance is no longer needed is a good change i think it can confidently go in
815,suggest adding the enabled parameter see above so this gets as well when someone calls ensure absent
816,this function be called rewrite_blockinstance_config note the c in blockinstance so this would need the misisng c and the calls to it
817,not what i was saying just like public static float density if density density.anydpi density density.xxhigh.getdpivalue return density.getdpivalue float density.medium.getdpivalue but whatever its not a big deal
818,longer term why are we not just using monotonic timers on x86 still this is known good we can take it as an action item as there might be a reason
819,will update the currently commented font.family in another change i will need to add the font first
820,prefer if was used throughout instead of as a bonus op_t would only occur once in the variable declaration and then the typedef could easily be removed
821,bit can go as well but its copied from the commit message the primary goal of the commit is to ensure that things dont crash however there was an attempt at making the fix work with the least slowdown perhaps that bit can go out and just mention the stuff about reentrancy EMO_POS
822,you move on top of the file like other dissector file
823,git commit line needs a continuation character to include the following m line however you should be able to fold the entire commit message into one quoted string starting on the above line be sure to leave the second line blank
824,parameter i need to print it i think it holds the centralauth logging you in to the following wikis
825,we dont need anything that it provides checking that the value is not none and encoding it so theres not much point pulling it out of the loop below actually we would have to leave it in the loop below as well since it uses the outer variable
826,it defined here just declare it extern in the header otherwise each file that includes packetusb.h will get its own copy
827,prepared that these logs wont show up at least they dont on my windows machine seems like logs outside the test itself do not appear
828,would suggest lg_msg_invalid_arg instead in all the places
829,correct me if im wrong but we have instances of commands in the flow you described this means they do not share state the change done by arik adds messages on the candoactionmessages collection of each one of the commands not sure how youre going to have this mix
830,that the rtl prefix removal is planned to be done by a scripted change somewhen in the near future so while this change is ok it should be less work for both you and the review if you do not specifically aim for these changes
831,this necessary though would anything bad happen if we encode to utf8 also it looks like this exists to make sure that we arent using utf16 or something else in which case we would definitely want to keep this even in python3
832,can actually remove this entirely i needed it to work around a bug in lcb when connecting to a nonstandard port i.e running on port instead of for use in perfrunner with standard packages we probably want ccp
833,is an overloaded term in programming is it an actual term in the source documents or can we use a different term here is type the same as mib
834,bob i think the setting of screen resolution is not important as it makes no different when i changed it to smaller or larger size therefore i chose the medium size its hard to figure out what date of rendering the map and it does not really affect to the embed code i will remove it from the code
835,curious how come you use a randomaccessfile here it might be simpler to just guava which lint already depends on EMO_NEG string firstline charsets.us_ascii thats com.google.common.io.files
836,looks fine but please fix up this bad rebase
837,that is supposed to be there i think its confusing having some functions being and some others being so thats why the comment is there so i can fix this up at a later commit let me do that right now actually URL
838,displayable is not ideal looking for something that means not internal how about getnoninternalfieldmodifiers given theyre hidden apis internal comments i suggest not wasting any time on this my point is the comment is not as clear to me as i think it could be feel free to act on the suggestion or ignore the later draft is clearer
839,i mentioned in the commit message that its undocumented
840,are wrapper functions and will use in test cases directly
841,is again not showing me external callers in this series of patches EMO_NEG who is using this
842,sure where these param are from args or kwargs suggest to doc them clearly param args param kwargs a dict of keyword arguments to be passed to the method which should contain parameters
843,were not storing the user_token in the cache we store the data after decrypting and jsondecoding if clients were passing in token hashes only we wouldnt know that it was originally pki
844,does not really explain what the issue was when new sd creation failed failure status was not checked and flow continued to try and attach the sd to a pool which obviously failed and returned a storage domain not found error instead of the creation failure sd creation status is now checked before proceeding
845,needed in this case since a set is being done immediately following
846,see your point there is place for improving my original suggestion the problem with your current code and new suggestion is you dont respect visibility during the whole loop but the outcome of the loop is entirely useless when current change is say a draft or when the user doesnt have acl to submit a change for a project example if this code is merged as is or with your new suggestion and you you dont have acl on gerritreview right would open a change that belongs to a topic that is shared by million of changes then you would iterate through all mil of changes just to say visible false right
847,there some missing code here that should go along with these name objects persimmon has some methods that go along with these might be worth looking in to
848,are right this wont work without the next patch use dbgroup instead of ldapgroup i will check again and i will probably have to merge both this patch and next one into one single patch
849,expert info if there is pad high and no pad low and also a generated hf with the padding length
850,will only contain bricks where the request has been sent a read will never have a bit corresponding to a brick being healed on set so the is not needed however for writes that also send the requests to bricks being healed doing the will cause that bricks that were unhealthy at the start of the operation will be marked again as bad after completing the operation even if the operation succeeded i think this is not correct
851,bit weird that you have this error change in populate but not in the constructor
852,will add a general error value and use it in this case
853,right i was in the library mindset i tried to mimic what runtimeexception does yes if we look at what i use here these would be useless at the moment
854,i think its cleaner we do not have to reimplement and maintain different versions startneededsrv in each script just one vdsm_init_common.sh startneededsrv to rule them all here we disagree but we repeat ourselves and not progressing so we can stop doing that and progress as whatever we have now is much better than whatever existed before when a maintainer opens the whatever he expects to actually understand what happens there and why and not start to dig within application to find issues and modify downstream specific logic at upstart of have the convention yeah you need something for legacy sysv but simple if is doing the work for systemd you need nothing as it handles the dependencies for openrc you need nothing as it handles the dependencies so the discussion is entirely around the sysv scripts i do remember that debian does have dependency management based on the header of so we left with rhel only to handle this is why i do not understand why we need any common application downstream specific logic URL
855,be addall with casting to list no please verify
856,must be count cfs_page_size otherwise the would overflow into the next page is the write is eaxctly pagesized
857,seem like we need a loop here we can use
858,if condition will be true when isdetailsrequired true and volumename is empty will it work do you need to add a validation against this scenario
859,verify this is correct EMO_POS this is as far i know the most special change i made other then the oustring things
860,typedef char named concept hard coded
861,will remove all of the debug and most of the other messages after the vectorimage is working main reason to use the logger is to print interleaved messages from multiple threads legibly other reason im avoiding debugmacro until vectorimage is working is so that i can continue to see debug messages even when compiled in release mode for speed
862,tobias can you please fix the spaces here i.e for thanks ghada
863,no point shuffling the deckchairs though assume that anything thats not yet is a bug and should just be moved straight to
864,dont need to drop the function as it will be dropped in the function db_create_trigger
865,probably meant that the comments should explain why not how but even that is missing here
866,i dont agree on treating the operation differently depending on whether the editor is modified or not in my opinion this should not affect the behavior what if for example theres only one change in the document the user bom but then triggers undo which would bring the editor to not modified state again what would one expect
867,not arm i am thinking about removing this ifndef
868,should put it into memcached_defaults instead that handles the upgrade scenario and will allow us to change the value easily in future
869,now with no inheritance
870,this case we only need to set it to zero because function compares instead when is zero thanks
871,you could add a real description yes its just something really minor EMO_POS
872,if its fatal we might as well just revert the serial patch the whole purpose of the serial or ehcidebug route is for platforms that dont support for whatever reason cbmem console log if its fatal here then the script wont run on those platforms making it impossible to collect the logs with this script im not going to fight it anymore though
873,map should also be updated probably via loop and calls to remove
874,could be done with a static const data array using the enum value as an index it would generate much less code in the end
875,is better but the registered variable is unnecessary while true if register_models EMO_NEG return or break
876,the output of this filter always be real this cast seems like is should be done outside this filter if its required it may be able to be done inplace for some situations
877,idea although i could now just have a single stat and remove if we have a stat called we can infer the status is there a policy though of maintaining stats any external tools reliant upon them that would be unhappy with removal of a stat
878,with just a can be replaced with just strdup EMO_POS this copy is necessary though since the string coming into the function might be packetscope
879,to chunks was added no in memory during vds operation
880,would be to have if nglobalerror pusherror nglobalerror return if ainputstring.isempty if else pushnovalue return
881,not remove the entire statement seekgroup has side effects
882,by a separate change through URL
883,and me like vdsm we already discussed this few month ago
884,would very much appreciate a better which are the keys and the values of this map
885,you put editable no need for editableontemplate its good for both
886,the exception is needed so it is rethrown if the user decides to cancel user can only see exception stack trace in the log
887,the correct thing for things execd from init i assume we can use logwrapper if we need to
888,does this method import to both the in memory cache and the disk cache if so that would be the source of some performance hits this method should add the image to the in memory cache synchronously add the image to the disk cache asynchronously if it doesnt do this currently lets split the logic up now
889,check was removed along with the corresponding genframebuffers and genrenderbuffers calls because they are checkfboresources bellow and the allocated buffers are leaked this is one of the bugs that my patch fixes in my patch the buffers are allocated only error checking in the allocatefboresources method
890,up hate all this stuff getting bikeshed for weeks for that sort of thing can you also check out
891,then why do you have the method_exists check it looked like you meant to check if a method exists before calling it but then never called the method just type hint as a wikipage to make this clearer and get rid of that check last_edit_title definitely needs a rename
892,get bool to int conversion warnings with these return calls.fix by return
893,set sorry the news be module is completely broken for me sql error then namespace errors but the news be module with suffers from the exact error my patch has fixed which would be reintroduced with this fix on top of that there is no point to check for the object we just created thus we either remove the check then we are back to the state before my patch which creates a warning please tell me the exact error that happens otherwise i can not reproduce the regression
894,you are rewriting the entire file anyway please try to put callers before callees in general so that reading the file top to bottom you usually know what a function is for when you see it so gen casebody caseclauses gencases
895,are missing usage list of ssh session ids to be closed or some such
896,probably say we are not clicking on the menu button
897,do not like the lower part here but if i set launchgitk function to be only one like this void qstring const qstring qstring i get error in gitplugin.cpp file on line gitk globalcontext true he can not recognize part any more if there is no function prototype with only one parameter
898,a big thing but sequence number should have been bumped
899,this equivalent to
900,the seems to be the preferred way of doing this and orca screenreader does not read out the fullstop so that is good
901,isnt automatically populated you need to ensure its filled in yourself unless you use the one that is already parsed and computed during validatechangelist and stored inside of the commits map
902,expect that to autounbox autounboxing be less efficient but its more readable and wont matter much for a test
903,thought that represents the last header that was written into the file is this incorrect
904,is an unrelated change that should be dropped
905,have tested it with this change everything works as expected i have nothing to say in addition to your words give me one day i will try to figure out tomorrow
906,please use the following codes to do the operations in parallel local do_nodes set_param n do_nodes set_param n
907,works EMO_POS still i think it might be nicer to do the check and call the error page from showbannereditor since thats the method that mostly deals with output this method just returns an array for form generation and may be called more than once in a single request
908,old code only replaced one instance not all but the string shouldnt contain more than one anyways
909,kwstyle in this file fix bracket indentations
910,the results as well as the wel needs to get a second l EMO_POS
911,you wrap arguments like this containing search pattern in double quotes please fish shell and probably zsh and alike fails to execute it without it
912,is none by default here and in is the same if project_id is not provided
913,needs to have been initialized to the correct size here jacobiantype jacobian dim
914,beforetest block is used all over the place in the tests we just try to get it to a clean state its slow but it works
915,was not possible updated to use the proper state variable
916,only reason i put it in here and not the missed snap function was that the new_volinfo was available to this one
917,is escapable could be something like
918,we mention the full classname here
919,easiest for you is ok with me EMO_POS another cl would be easier for reviewing i suppose but if you would rather throw it in here or create the class now and make another cl later to convert other existing code im fine with that as well
920,all you are doing here is testing that the object returned by network.get_by_id is passed to the allocated_fixed_ip method properly along with some other arguments the more clean and canonical way of doing that would be this USER_MENTION def get_by_id_mock EMO_NEG net_id with allocated_fixed_ip as allocate_mock fakeuuid host net_id net_id fakeuuid mock.sentinel.network
921,code now returns a reference to a temporary object
922,put sync groups in these contexts only as field text and put the rest in a note beneath the text field note leaving this field blank the user authentication contexts will be used help needed to let admins know how they need to enter the context
923,set looks good to me but someone else must approve inline comments reading the code it looks okay to me just minor things can be done upon commit imho
924,dont declare symbols weak provide weak definitions
925,either useless or not if its useless remove note that we do not like transitive includes though
926,about making mapanonymous return null so that we only need the single check that table_mem_map_.get nullptr
927,started with standard reentrantlocks here but when adding the lookfor method i realized that that is a readonly operation so concurrent queries didnt need to block each other
928,set i would prefer that you didnt submit this i like it but it fails a fatal is triggered if the table is empty test just truncate the table after update a refresh reload should be done or something so the date is then current or this should be handled by js answer
929,three tests above that checks namespaces should probably grouped together they seems to be copy pasted and just change which setting is gathered you could uses a dataprovider too that will build an array of tests cases and pass the case to a test method anyway you should extract the foreach assert in a new internal method such as assertnamespaceisvalid
930,is the line which triggers the crash createqmlobject requires the calling context to be valid if this callback is invoked from via the event loop it has a chance to crash note that using damians repro also uncovered a crash in which could hide the crash issue in qml but thats a separate issue which needs to be tracked separately the fix is trivial just a null ptr check on the ftp ptr
931,to rephrase if inode table limit has been reached then better to increase the limit of
932,url would be URL
933,probably the most appropriate name here
934,to guard this with a static bool so its only executed once assuming the above her_dissector_delete is removed
935,could impact the development context when doing a partial compilation is it noticable we should reuse the filename microop
936,points
937,parameter name i suppose it was late when you added it EMO_POS
938,double checked the rest command i used to delete emails it wasnt a typo because i used the exact same command with an admin user and it worked just fine it was only when i used the user with canmodifyaccount permission that it didnt work could the not found message be from the email.parse in email.java requiring administrator permission
939,you want it really obvious what type the variable is EMO_POS
940,more sleeps i think were up to seconds now
941,have reused some cmake code i had it should be some left over from the copypaste
942,condition must always be true here so rather use sal_warn
943,dont do that we manipulate datetimeutils.setcurrentmillisprovider to achieve what you want check changeeditit for example methods annotated with USER_MENTION and USER_MENTION URL
944,kind of discussed this last time and thought that we didnt want to fail any calls if the operators were not recognised
945,functions return errno as ret this can be passed to the gf_msg function
946,to swap the layout when obj1 obj2 should just return i.e be noop there should also be a check that the two objects have the same uid and gid and that the uid doing the swap is either owner or has cap_fowner since this would ensure the process isnt trying to steal data i.e the process doing this could read and overwrite the data if it wanted
947,a fan of createpopupmenu its huge and hard to read reset columns i will do i can be convinced of using cpm too
948,will always be nil right as above i think you can remove this argument
949,would help to have a dht_msg_disk_layout_missing msgid here
950,and the preferences load below have a race condition if the plugin load finishes first the user might see the existing account dashboard screen instead of their first my link if token mine
951,include agesa headers in a public coreboot header are you out of your mind
952,macros in southbridge.h are vortex86ex pci config register offsets they are all fixed for vortex86ex cpu
953,there any practical reason to skip class literals in jsinterface chains other than code size please add an explanation here
954,a comment and explain two different use cases existing edit is deleted delete path in non existing edit is deleted iow new edit is created by deleting a path in current patch set for a change delete
955,set fails well looks much better you fixed the alerts but in iscsi block master domain i get attribute error on missing dom EMO_NEG EMO_NEG prepareforshutdown failed to stop repostats thread traceback most recent call last EMO_NEG file line in prepareforshutdown attributeerror setmaxhostid object has no attribute stoprepostats
956,looks like this allows a user who cannot see all branches to probe which branches exist by looking at the error message it doesnt exist vs user does not have rights to delete it a user can detect if a branch that is not visible to him exists
957,xml return code will be zero for both success and failures this may fail for invalid volume name
958,currently its somewhat different from what the current reference data approach uses as i guess that you would want to generate that state using some code that is not part of the test since if you can generate the state with code that runs anywhere you do not really benefit from serialization generic serialization is also a significant amount of code even if straightforward and with it requires some careful thinking on what kind of constraints it enforces on the serializable types unless you make the object itself responsible for the serialization
959,changing an swfield which is part of the document model during export is bad an export operation should just read the document model and serialize it in some format cant you set m_bcitation depending on what the field type is just put a breakpoint on the swfield constructor get a backtrace and see where its created hopefully the caller knows the field type
960,assume this is something thats required if signature is not provided if so throw an exception here or remove it completely from code
961,line matches the illegal pattern more than one blank line
962,preforming this check multiple times its better to create a separate function in case we will need to add a new localhost
963,is just a nit and i dont actually care but i skimmed and noticed that other operation strings were eg getting im not sure how consistent that is or if you want them to be consistent
964,this marked latest in the other place its defined
965,the perils of copypaste updated to ecdhersaaes256gcmsha384
966,shouldnt need this i have a patch in flight to our gtest see URL which will make the gtest asset macros understood by clang analyser
967,think this can be refactored with the rtu duplication into the modbus dissector
968,we need to enforce the same type for all elements in the array or do we not care as long its one of the string primitives
969,should be fields since everything the old messaging system info and the new social profile websites is now socialprofile we differentiate among these with note field
970,my proposal is to see boot as a helper for deploy driver or to any other interface or anyone else rather than to see it as a separate interface boot should just take care of getting the bare metal booted to the required environment whether for ironic to perform an operation or to boot the userrequested image thinking in these lines i would think boot interface should refrain from participating in cleaning boot interface should participate in cleaning only if it had something to clean up on the bare metal node that would take a lot of time in my mind there isnt anything we can discuss in the irc
971,from heap to stack based allocation will now only allocate enough to hold idmap header
972,caveat here about indexof and search results
973,have a question why do you add changes for software_config and software_deployment tables here as far i understand they were fixed in previous patch for both tables
974,yeah that was my first way of fixing the original warning but when i looked over the class more i realised just removing the checks would be better will fix
975,wonder where you see that i dont maybe its not explicit enough for your taste in telling you that you are an idiot if you try make the setup script simply refuse such qt versions
976,add a comment i dont think ifdef is a good idea it makes bugs more likely because you have more code and that code is less tested because only one version is only compiled and run on any one system but i will include the nonworkaround version in the comment
977,bumping the schema number forces a reindex to pick up the new file format lucenechangeindex has this.usedocvaluesforsorting schema.getversion
978,take a look after we decide how to move forward
979,length you can also use here
980,think there was a problem with dtors as well not too relevant as we dont support unloading anyway
981,like this test case because it is more realistic than the expression above but then id prefer that we remove the other one
982,like we can make use of the dependent option gear in so that the default is on for real windows and off otherwise
983,that isnt true now is it because only and blob friends have
984,note that according to URL the values table tablerow and tablecell are not supported in ie7 and earlier ie8 requires a doctype URL
985,include wont become redundant as the macros will still be needed instead the replicated will become redundant
986,guess i dont need to understand why one is better than the other EMO_POS
987,use exceptions for control flow use ints.tryparse instead
988,feeling funky and not particularly dry in here do you think we should have a more consolidated response handler then have these functions simply access already processed data
989,note the comment on sc_globstr_str_count which is the overall count of strings so actually you need to insert and define str_table_count to and increment the value of sc_globstr_str_count to
990,think you could use a better method name something like network_id_cmp for example
991,stored to offset is never read clang analyzer
992,good point i hadnt noticed that patch get merged have removed the field_exists and table_exists checks
993,is untrusted input whereas c and microcode end are trusted theres no risk of overflow
994,shortened to isipv4 but i dont think preferipv4 is correct seems reasonable but doesnt actually prefer ipv4
995,weve got this do we still need the flag this field should probably be called something more like allocated_stack_size
996,think they are trying to match with the access control section data which uses local because it used to also have the inherited rules from parent projects and the local rules were in their own collection so the ui could tell them apart
997,consistency this could be named storeinhttpsession
998,catch my bad it differs in master see iadfa1fb78e101e67ed47a6f3b5ea88ff12c90ca6
999,need for indentation on the last line or even the preceding newline for that matter
1000,functionality is insanely useful for out of the box development against a random sysroot this would also be a fairly insane place to remove this if block even if i was feeling particularly murderous
1001,may result in broken implementations since they could already have a longer url highly unlikely but possible
1002,does not appear that you need this treecolorset
1003,define this as a new function instead of replacing the one that expects a namedelement getfuncname is invoked on actions but also on guards and we need to apply the new naming on guards as well if we replace the old getfuncname with this one but keeping the namedelement parameter we can move the translator.getsource part here and be able to reuse the same function without modifying the actiondeclarationgenerator or the guarddeclarationgenerator
1004,output html is along the lines of the colon seems implied by the im not sure whether it should be added in the messages or with css or just left implied or if we should have these be punctuated as sentences and ignore the semanticallyimplied colon
1005,generateinputrequestedregion be virtual in all classes perhaps there is not global rule git master git grep l git master git grep l
1006,tests wont link if i leave the macros out f.e tst_qpropertyanimation tst_qitemmodel tst_qsettings
1007,consequent with naming of method an var isavisible return avisible or isvisiblea return visiblea
1008,is missing in addition id prefer to have a setter or only getter that can be mocked for this constant this would be cleaner than having this as a method parameter
1009,will do this for all remaining get_top_of_ram in one go separate from this fam10 patch
1010,this patch only be added if is no
1011,is a good place for the cache flush in the sense that it is already machinespecific but yes its fine to take this approach lgtm
1012,this is considered a development tool and not a production tool it should have local_module_tags eng
1013,to me it would have been safer to keep the chain as is but introduce the validation check explicitly but if you think this is okay too then ill shut up
1014,the selection of the common part be moved one level higher until a fintek chip comes along which is different no idea if that is possible in kconfig
1015,should check tvb_captured_length first to make sure there is enough data to run the heuristic otherwise it might throw an exception just checking and prevent subsequent heuristics from claiming the packet appropriately
1016,did not make comments on all of these before because it was the same comment every time unless there is a good documented reason these should all be set to ignore
1017,feels wrong to be doing this sort of checking in this class it is huge already i suspect that passing in the appropriate merge strategy via the factory would be cleaner
1018,you dont need these brackets or you need brackets above where you do icmp_echo icmp_echoreply can you make the two consistent
1019,add the comment to say that new_filename will be ignored in the auto compaction mode
1020,good catch i didnt see the enclosing call to the title class there i was assuming the output of title was being passed to returnto seems some really nasty logic going on with reusing variables and typecasting to strings etc
1021,gregor continuing on from the mandatory system fields the below code will save the socialprofile data elseif socialprofile for new social profiles new thanks ghada
1022,the latest patch you switched from glib memory to wmem memory so you do not want to call g_free but you still want to destroy the hash table itself otherwise you are leaking memory so switch to g_hash_table_new instead of g_hash_table_new_full and put back the call to g_hash_table_destroy
1023,no version can be parsed is the result
1024,point is to use double quotation marks instead of single quotation marks for consistency within mediawiki core and all extensions
1025,pointers are initialized to null already in there constructor
1026,not how its currently implemented instead the interwikimap should be consulted to see whether a interwiki link is local and as soon as a nonlocal interwiki link is happening throwing this exception but as invalidtitle of course how is an invalid link ive added that to the link tests and its fine and doesnt work as the meatball wiki appears to have no interwiki map
1027,control keywords must be followed by a single space
1028,idea was just to drop the parent class and move the methods down to the only inheriting class but i can modify the in one shot
1029,not just adjust the check upstairs to microcode_end then you wont need this check if you assume that cbfs is correct and if you dont cbfs check belongs to cbfs functions not here
1030,spaces inside parentheses throughout i.e xyz xyz
1031,this makes no sense you should have just amended it if you didnt want to wait for the roundtrip
1032,would like to see URL fixed up and then these headers fixed up either as a dependency for this or as a patch on immediately on top of this include include
1033,those tracking trunk we cannot delete this migration just need to make a new migration that migrates the data and then drops this table
1034,to unify the translation of to me sounds better
1035,set EMO_NEG inline comments the split string constants make me sad but im not sure upstream uboot has signed onto that sanity yet like the linux kernel
1036,think you miss the complicated case of a conflmict between a move in a branch vs a uncontrolling in another branch in which case there is a deletion compared to origin on one side and a rename on the other side
1037,this comment the old css resource has no support for many atrules like animations there is no way for us to parse them using the old css parser so we will just output them as a string to the gss stylesheet and hope that the gss parser is okay with the rule
1038,should be rather initialized with an empty collection
1039,the pointer is only set in the ctor so it should be const similarly in key2stylecontext
1040,lets improve documentation thanks for comments
1041,we sure the the same set of changes are not required for other daemons as well
1042,getposition doesnt handle errors but seek does EMO_NEG
1043,add a space between if and its opening pare
1044,it margin or padding see e.g URL
1045,be if since colpos is set using thus the type must be the same just have to remove a few lines before
1046,could directly call processbufferedmessages here but i did it this way to avoid duplicate code for the logging here and in the instance below
1047,i fix this or change it to a nonjavadoc comment
1048,on allocation failures is discouraged so remove this
1049,we write a test for this it seems to be an important semantic aspect of the interface worth recording
1050,to do that in a separate changelist for mb14866 merge lock with seqno_list into the same structure maintain a vbmap instead of vblist in this service so as to make vbno faster do vbno validation in all relevant places in the service you mentioned that we could use list of list instead of map of list to avoid issues with map feel that it makes the code harder to read we may have to understandard the behavior with maps anyway plan to make the changes above and see if the issue in mb14866 recur
1051,take an error_list from the framework here but message is passed as an argument looking at how message is constructed this also could be generated here there is no need to pass it through argument so either both message and error_list are this function arguments or none of them
1052,this the right api an alternative is func runeset ttrue tfalse transformer transformer type runeset interface bool and have unicode.rangetable implement this interface if performance is a concern the if function could do a type assertion to see if s is a and switch to an optimized implementation the same way that the package does in the stdlib but im not sure if we even want a ranges or if the point of the transformer interface is to transform things in bulk if youre going to be chopping between two separate transformers depending on the input runes then it seems like youre not getting the benefit of transforming in bulk instead id just loop over the input and append to a its not like you have some input that contains both code page and shiftjis and you want to switch between them your phone number ranges example seems a bit contrived and again id just over the string for that particular task as for titlecasing latin but not greek is that something that people really want to do i wonder what rob thinks can you start a separate email thread just for api design
1053,guess jcuken is an alternate keyboard how will we test it narayam does not support nonqwerty keyboards
1054,status is the best here i cannot use status from the current response here also i dont know status of the other responses here
1055,is a ondxpageptr which is derived from which has an ondxpage but the old code called which does something different than the one
1056,is device init path is not it so changing the od_track_declares after the fact would not retroactively enable this feature we might as well change it to a module parameter then if this is the way we want to go
1057,is out EMO_POS this required could be still added in the version specification to the find_package call for this example though
1058,its more readable but how about handlerregistrationcollection hrc new handlerregistrationcollection or handlerregistrationcollection hrc new handlerregistrationcollection handlerregistration hr1 handlerregistration hr2 i.e accumulate handlerregistration instances right into the hrc which can be a field of your class rather than into local variables that you then pass as a whole to the factory method if you want varargs you could add an addall method handlerregistrationcollection hrc new handlerregistrationcollection hr2 or with a collection or iterable as argument handlerregistrationcollection hrc new handlerregistrationcollection hr2 note that sencha has not felt the need to add such to their groupinghandlerregistration URL similar for gwtps registerhandler on their presenterwidget base class URL
1059,do have kwstyle but somehow i think it only complains if i have endofline whitespace ill remove the tabs
1060,info line would be consistent with the dwarf.new arg order ditto in
1061,should probably be ignore it is not part of the explicit itk style specification
1062,comment should indicate that using the itk3dversorrigid transform is often a much better transform to use during optimization proceedures from both a speed perspective lower dimensional parameter space and stability standpoint versors do not suffer from rotational gimble lock
1063,update this comment to give an example of the unparseable credentials
1064,im not saying to have xxhdpi passed in im just saying that right here you could put the code that i put above like when computing the scaling factor if we see anydpi use xxhdpi instead this is a silly thing to go back and forth on and it doesnt really matter much
1065,you plan to address the runtime problem with n calls to cinder where n is the number of hosts
1066,except for the fact that get_initial_timestamp doesnt exist for fam10h and implementation looks nontrivial
1067,should read this survey tests the local metadata performance using the echo_client to drive the mdd layer to perform operations it is run with multiple threads to simulate mdt service threads locally on the mds node and does not need lustre clients in order to run
1068,histograms themselves dont use multipoint storage the input for them often would be but in this case it isnt
1069,ide feature does not provide any team dependent plugins any longer but it makes sense to keep the dependency i didnt realize that team.ui contributed a bunch of functionality that doesnt necessarily require a mylyn team extension
1070,should be references with an s see cite.git line
1071,nigel is it better to use nbsp instead of in case other screens want to use this in the future its more generic but its up to you it actually works quite well the way it is thanks ghada
1072,tried to make the unary member operators but apparently even gtest requires binary comparison operators to work on objects so ill have to abandon that
1073,in URL
1074,be better to name this view rather than window
1075,have no idea what to write here other than copying the dictionary definition of the word virtual at the moment it basically means entities that are not backed by a file but defining things by what they are not is bad and also might not be true in the future
1076,cant be here since it only executes on the first cmake run making linear_algebra_libraries break on subsequent runs
1077,elementtree i can create an element and provide the attributes as a dict see implementation below its much easier minidom is too much limited URL
1078,you look at the previous version of the code we returned true if the new one didnt contain engine i just noticed that i need to nuke out the engine params from setting d
1079,will cause the mkfsopt to skip mkfsoptions string if mkfsopt is empty and
1080,i suspect these classert lines were removed in an earlier version of the patch but not restored when the padding was added back without these it us likely that a defect will be added on bigendian machines when these fields are actually used
1081,this two functions are unnecessary there are only validates oh my better if will be done in the level using the parameters
1082,this was removed is clearly wrong and seems to be the cause for the test which hang it doesnt always hang but sometimes for more details URL
1083,doesnt seem right should it not be left as destination dir
1084,actually misguided you here typename was already fully qualified and looks enough to figure out what the message was saying and find culprits for some reason i thought this was the member name and not qualified anyway sorry about that you may consider reverting the related change to keep it consistent and make the code slightly simpler by getting rid of maps anyway i will leave it up to you how to proceed
1085,performing the static code analysis using cppcheck
1086,tests for other resource type i feel there should be a test that ensure the issue in the bug is resolved it also verifies that the generated.xml can at least run through aapt
1087,did not get your point please fix it as you think appropriate
1088,should explain that this set is only needed so we can create an duplicate free pkglist
1089,are essentially renamed to projectscopedpayload.version etc in a dependent change URL
1090,set now it looks good yeah it worked in the first patch set but the rebase missed the comma
1091,things like twitter facebook linkedin are very popular right now i think we should have them in the list so that their proper icons are used maybe we could have an admin extensions configuration form for this so an admin can add new options when needed that records the name that will appear in the dropdown and where to find its related icon but maybe this will be a patch for a later time
1092,are we guaranteeing that when we invoke this clean up there are no threads consuming these rpcs
1093,every callback is only interested at the part starting at the token what about using frame offset here and dropping the p frame in the callbacks
1094,static modifier out of order with the jls suggestions
1095,probably want tvb_reported_length_remaining here
1096,this logic to procjectcontrol will also require additional modifications in receivecommits my approach fixes both issues in one place also this approach protect us from making same error in future personally i wouldnt move this logic to upper level signature of this method can be changed to revwalk revobject instead of using repository but imo will keep this logic here to prevent from this issue in future
1097,rebase the fsp with tool bct
1098,should be allowed to reset when resetting features.quotadeemstatfs it should be cleared when quota is disabled it should be set to on when quota is enabled
1099,will translate this stepbystep guide into devgwtsuperdevmode.txt or some such in the next patch set
1100,sure how important this is but other lines seem to have a tab at the beginning of the line and the added lines uses spaces d
1101,ll_setattr_raw EMO_NEG we tested rc before and it was false
1102,misaligned typedefs should be causing kwstyle errors are you not getting any
1103,variables are used by everyone deriving from gerritcommand it should be pushed up as well and the
1104,can do that in an extra commit here i only wanted to add the possibility to access the created proto_item but if you want me to i can add the change to this commit also
1105,good will update once the dependence URL is merged
1106,set i would prefer that you didnt submit this please fix the indent pep8 errors in gluster_cli_tests.py at least
1107,far as i can tell from documentation no exceptions are thrown reworking it slightly anyway move chdir closer to loop and adding for safety against possibly careless maintenance programming
1108,comments must be followed by a space and be on their own line
1109,of must be inside brackets even if it is only one line
1110,no new abstract functions in the api classes please
1111,might want to use a constant scriptrunner.nop instead
1112,a user term isnt returned i believe youll get npes when displaying lists of changes thats why i wrote URL so that this error is discovered early and is properly reported i was a while since i looked at it and the code mightve changed since then so dont take my word for it
1113,this was copied from another it and the gav was not changed it will conflict with the other it when mvn install installs it into the local repo its a good idea to make all gavs used in test projects specific to the it that is being run to avoid unwanted between unrelated its esp when they are being run in parallel and i know some its we have are not good examples for this i.e same comment applies to all pom.xmls used here for test projects
1114,is marketing let the code speak for itself EMO_POS
1115,isnt going to pass pep8 anyway because this line is too long and the parameters to getattr dont have proper spacing and why are we still looking at exc.message here
1116,would prefer to keep this it is possible for the rild and radio code to pass the sequence number through into radio state as the request is being acted on the rild may notice the socket error and reestablish the connection and then the response comes back from the radio with the old sequence number and gets passed back through the newlyconnected rild just because your implementation may not do this we can imagine other oems passing back obsolete responses that would match a newlyzerod ril sequence number and confuse things couldnt you just remember the first sequence number your rild connection received then you know the number of requests youve received
1117,use
1118,can add at the end the following args j8 but that wont work for windows moreover we need to provide the generator i was lucky enough that the system was picking the last one that i used so we might need to stick with a cmake call that configure the pom for you so maybe for external build tree that tree should probably became the place where maven should be run instead of the maven source dir
1119,agree if the file exist we should skip the conversion and print a information message
1120,a comment is behind the field it describes doxygen needs with a symbolized left arrow to realize it correctly
1121,remove border and blank line between class definition and comment and consequently reduce it to a single line
1122,point we need to make sure that we use jsonrpc
1123,
1124,seeing this live on gerritreview i think this is noisy every change seems to have conflicting changes which i think is just an artifact of there being lots of old unlikelytomerge but still open changes in the project i would prefer something like including with a link to the full search without that restriction
1125,that be u_i sum_k u_k
1126,helper would be a good start EMO_POS dmhelper.c might be a useful place to tuck these p
1127,prefer the alcatellucent.xylan i will update the dicto after
1128,about abstracting this even further instead of requiring a region_device to describe the location we could just accept the name of an fmap region and look up its offset and size
1129,dont think we need to have these messages in our repository of messages for gss analysis
1130,you explain why we need wrap this code in guiactionrunner
1131,set david it used to be that you needed to land both the stable and the cros workon ebuild at the same time has that been fixed and you can just land the thats right you only need to land the now actually its been supported since at least oct but yeah there used to be a bug
1132,mehdi you are right i am very sorry i have misinterpreted the deviceruntimeversion as the version of deviceruntimeonhostmachine
1133,and itksetinputmacro are itk wrappers for name and name im not sure what you think is wrong here please elaborate
1134,probably make this if we see that we need it outside this module we can always drop the leading underscore
1135,remove this empty line you apparently have the wrong commitmsg hook how and when precisely did you obtain it
1136,we should explicitely add coverage for the method youre adding so we could isolate any problem later on
1137,is this rounding necessary just a guess clock skew
1138,need to be redundant described in the report but this is bogus anyway commit message are expected to be selfcontained and the bug links are merely for more info see style
1139,would be would to expand into main stats view in server or similar
1140,would be useful to add a short comment here with the kernel version in which this api changed so that it is easier to clean up later
1141,you swap a key_right for a key_left in rtl thats because youre interested in the start of the line which is on the left in ltr rather than the left vs right so in the case key_left the comment could say start of the line no special rtl handling
1142,omitting other kinds of completion proposals on a specific purpose or just a way to keep the patch small and you currently dont need more this kinda contradicts the use of the general type binding rather than methodbinding looks like you couldnt make up your mind
1143,im all for small tests EMO_POS but here we need data in the queue to flush it and data to be present to take it so they kind of need to be done in sequence
1144,just thought because i removed not supported stuff tested it and improve code quality qulifies me ill remove it
1145,here warning and link to the linking documentation of alternative openid provider and date that google shuts down openid service
1146,im concerned about the lock contention in this function as multiple threads will likely invoke this function this can affect the crud performance can we simply use an atomic variable for each latency stat
1147,is more obvious in this file than the other you should be escaping the periods in your regular expressions i know that it will match the period in the url anyway but we want it to match the period also you should use specific matches for scid height and width rather than the period match anything assuming that youre just matching numbers or tentatively would be better here one more thing if these sites provide copyandpaste embed tags these matches will need to be able to deal with those too currently they look like they will just modify the url inplace and this is definitely not what we want
1148,like the order of the parameters are reversed it should be expected actual
1149,uploaded an alternative in patch set which you might dislike less EMO_POS
1150,would like to rewrite in but that requires all the calling programs to be too will do that in a separate patch
1151,this only relevant for new js interop or was it also a bug with regular jsos if it was a bug with jsos we should add the relevant regression test
1152,about while next null reg_number if gettype return next next return nullptr
1153,id like to keep the api of this class close to objectid
1154,happen when you pass the same email and ask to delete it and set as preferred make it sense to check for this and reject this case as mutually exclusive options
1155,language style needs to be instructive rather than conversational here this is primarily intended for the software guide remove the therefore and for instance and make the sentences more authoritative
1156,previous event may not be traceevgocreate like this scenario when trace start goroute is in syscall and then exitsyscall and finally gostart for this case we cant access the stack information because the previous event is traceevgosysexit which doesnt contain the stack i just think out a solution when we receive a traceevgosysexit we reserve the gocreate event by link it and access it here but i dont know if there are any other cases or any side effect any idea
1157,is reachable via allgs so wb can be eliminated
1158,use russian peasant algorithm adapted for exponentiation
1159,you sure about this loop which does not run EMO_POS
1160,can actually allocate a buffer which would be bigger enough to store the message
1161,confused why this changes the string you fputs but not the fn
1162,does not correspond to an issue on the gerrit issue tracker issues should be listed in the change footer in the form bug issue URL
1163,our discussion make this a class thats just the combobox maybe like androidapicombo
1164,doesnt work properly when the index is negative e.g time is before the offset
1165,of the spring stuff looks like it can be found in the default m2 repo why do we need this also milestone is wrong here
1166,makes sure we dont have a bug where we silently drop object files
1167,arguments to init should be documented somewhere
1168,we any chance to detect whether the call was made from outside the typo3 namespace otherwise well get lots of deprecations if we call a public method from another class in core which is public but not part of the api
1169,but i didnt get why we need here to trigger some update to afterwards what if we just fix the update for afterwards then
1170,is an attempt to clear the following dashboard error URL
1171,still an executable file as opposed to say a linux application that you build on windows and which has a file with an extension msi that would most likely not be an executable
1172,creates an unnecessary garbage list sets.newhashset should accept an iterable
1173,example contains both actual examples and metalanguage permission maybe pick one representation and stick to it group administrators or read group administrators open re what formatting to apply to metalanguage
1174,seems a bit error prone and hacky to me what if was true before it would be false afterwards probably not relevant here but maybe elsewhere what about a second argument in getnode that allows to even fetch nodes
1175,getresource with false for the parameter loadondemand instead of true to be lazy
1176,for whatever reason i thought temp_failure_retry stopped after retries i dont know why i thought that and its clearly not in the code ugh getting late
1177,meant these but we actually print the bypasslocal value with it so it doesnt matter much nevermind
1178,why not format this normally as is already done in functions below ptr char update
1179,right the to global is a nicer idea i have just removed jquery statement and did not add the global that is just a few errors and they do need fixing
1180,the client always linux hmm client is a terrible name ive no idea what im looking at here i was planning on moving those files that currently have client in the name there it seems to mean device usb_linux_client is the deviceside code usb_linux is the hostside code likewise adb_auth adb_client.cpp doesnt fit this pattern though its a mixture and for file_sync client is the and service is the device
1181,autogenerated crud methods you dont need to define these methods manually please check this patch URL
1182,there a reason we are not doing stuff like the below which seems to me would better across a wider range of machines lockfocusflipped not available before osx if else setflipped
1183,about get the original length of the packet may be larger than the captured length if the snaplen dumpcap s is in effect or something that clarifies the relation
1184,would prefer the previous formatting of line breaks
1185,should also be updated to match the actual latest kernel version as above
1186,sorry i assumed that this function was tested and it seems trivial to me since in this works like a charm would you mind sending a patch fixing the fn_db_delete_config_values as well and put me as a reviewer thanks
1187,far prefer the naming since anybody who has ever worked with simd will know exactly what were doing the point is to maybe make the simd code slightly less cluttered and make it possible to for some simple routines to be templated not to design a new language
1188,set the indexer usage was not changed it just fixes the bug and it works EMO_POS adapting to the new indexer is yet another task of course
1189,dont like either style dont like c here i can change it if it helps to get this pulled
1190,hsc in exceptions please the exception handler does take care of proper encoding
1191,we might grep in for project and only add if none was given but then we could do the same with branch and status default branch master default status open logerrit query would be translated to how about it
1192,catch i should blame autocomplete p
1193,self.network_interfaces
1194,not move this up into the anonymous namespace above it is harder to read going from rwmolecule to internal class and back again maybe i missed something subtle if so maybe we could add a brief comment
1195,own
1196,usage of exception specification here is very bad if any only exception is thrown then the program will terminate imagine what will happen if that occurred in slicer have you verified that not a single method usage can throw an exception of a different kind
1197,is complaining about these parameters being null
1198,is the simplest way to make it build the complicated way would be to change dobeforetest so it throws a throwable instead of an exception
1199,same strange package should it be wst
1200,use uint64 or uint32 or uint16 if the size is known
1201,adds more things to go wrong than just downloading everything again to do a reinstall i understand the desire downloads are a pain but downloading again is a much more predictable zero state than some set of possiblycorrect archives on local disk checked against some possiblycorrect set of hashes all of which is a lot of extra moving parts to work around a problem slow connections is it worth it maybe but it is a lot more to go wrong
1202,word selected should be capitalized im unsure of the use of area here btw maybe cut selection
1203,probably should ensure the project is clean before doing this otherwise a user might lose uncommitted changes they care about project project manifest self.manifest name path remote gitdir path git worktree path relpath path revision head if project.isdirty print error cannot remove uncommitted changes are present project.relpath print commit changes then run sync again else
1204,need to check for null because g_strdup will do this and if value null then will be uninitialised
1205,dont see why we should reject a number entry that we can understand just to adhere strictly to the locale but ill ask an expert what libreoffice does in other areas and we should just do the same my assumption is that we should definitely accept native digits but why reject ascii digits
1206,shouldnt check fdb_itr_no_deletes again because we already checked it above
1207,not to include topic when this really implemented
1208,side effect of the refactoring i used to create the haswholeworldknowledge method fixed
1209,think the bytes.buffer version was more readable
1210,it be worth to mention that the review notes are written by the reviewnotes plugin
1211,why out that in a comment instead of just using below
1212,handle all these exceptions in the same way so you can use multicatch catch revisionsyntaxexception ambiguousobjectexception incorrectobjecttypeexception ioexception e
1213,set verified by team member looks good to me approved i could not reproduce the errors however the changes look straightforward
1214,just doesnt seem right ones created by a call to generate_key are trivially generated and not imported if were at the point where this code is lying to you then the app cant trust the origin tag regardless
1215,the find_package call actually needs to be in the itkmoduleinit.cmake file to make the imported targets visible globally everything else should be able to go inside the module cmakelists.txt file
1216,happens if this fails how do we ensure ssh is killed maybe a trap would be more supportable
1217,done removed the function and function calls thanks
1218,as well if null strpos continue
1219,follows the common toxx naming convention and implementation style used in guava i need fix the documentation
1220,left click or drag to extend t1 of a current range always changes t1 to t2 and t2 to t1
1221,major documentation work in the next few weeks so we can all use our time more efficiently when new or wasntpayingattentionthen developers come on board today only worried about completing the rc while not creating repeat work later EMO_POS
1222,it was the wait feature that you now find workable from python the nowait argument disables that new feature reverting back to prior behavior
1223,two comments seem to be for the block of commands
1224,note for future patch replace static references by the proper dao getter
1225,up with other just set reserved case statements
1226,already have another use case if an app needs per package log configuration as in jdk this is good way to support that so i prefer to keep it as it doesnt complicate the code
1227,thanks i discovered this myself early last week and addressed it in i82ff6602af3bf5 so that we use gcc on slaves where that matters love these commercialgrade compilers
1228,the functions should simply take xmltextreaderptr shared_ptr is only used to manage the lifetime of the reader so it is impl detail i would even remove the typedef
1229,you combine the declaration of ctstr above with this assignment
1230,is a maven project and mavens default build directory is target see also the classpath file generated by m2eclipse
1231,about this case if user selected init in run once then we get here but also have payload configured
1232,chipset needs to override the generic
1233,a format with the ovirt engine format template will recover the format
1234,depends on how we define the abi for function prototype like void a double b float c now the argument registers would be we could remove this unless we define abi to use argument registers like
1235,complete would be
1236,dont think we should let people modify a branch that they dont have access to even if it is for a commit that they are replacing that used to be in another branch locked down is locked down right i see how it might be annoying to have to redo a change if you used the wrong branch the first time though perhaps there is some git magic that can let you do that painlessly
1237,if there were a clean way to have the old name mean a new q version thatd be fine but i think this is the best we can do
1238,change it to ws_info_t null
1239,a direct english string here means it cant be translated EMO_NEG you can do a grep for e.g rid_svxstr_load_error for a sample trivial translatable string example you can follow to get a translatable string here
1240,kept this in r46 to keep some minor behaviour consistent by omitting this in r50 we are actually keeping the behaviour of rc and final consistent modulo the bug fix see this function in git diff since the r50 tests are already generated with the new rng we should expect those tests to continue to pass
1241,changes the semantics you actually want to die if theres no title given but we have a pageid
1242,you intending to add more artefact plugin settings
1243,we not use config_mmconf_base_address for these constants
1244,at all files in our source tree i see the following two cases a listener is just notified that an event happened but cannot do anything to that event in that case the listener doesnt throw any checked examples gitreferenceupdatedlistener headupdatedlistener auditlistener a listener can block the event in this case the listener throws a checked exception which is on the same level of abstraction as the listener interface examples commitvalidationlistener throws commitvalidationexception mergevalidationlistener throws mergevalidationexception since this listener is not intended to a group membership it belongs to the first category and shouldnt throw any exception
1245,doesnt look quite intuitive to me maybe i am not used to this style i like something as below however if you find the current style better feel free to keep it self.k8s_api
1246,your job is parse the service_profile to then pass it to the driver just let the driver take care of this directly less crosstalk and better separation
1247,maybe the loop can be inside this method it would be more consistent with the fact that starts is plural
1248,after the first mod a b is already by definition so the rest of this code is all done using natural numbers and thus could probably be slightly more efficient by using nats directly perhaps next cl
1249,should be a programlisting with language ini
1250,doesnt make too much sense to me as this file lives in the same directory hence double quotes and the use of double quotes with is inherently bogus
1251,ordered includes i.e vtk headers vtksys headers headers
1252,we are making a bunch of datastore calls in a loop which could fail or time out and drop half of the updates since this is derived data and an async update is probably okay a more robust approach would be to put tasks on the app engine task queue to refresh each graph failed tasks automatically get retried the most robust way to do the update given a graph id regenerate the graph from a query of all its dependencies sort of like a makefile then since its idempotent it doesnt matter if it fails sometimes and we can ignore concurrency as well since multiple writes dont matter incremental updates would be more efficient but trickier to get right so i typically put that off until it seems necessary
1253,per discussions on qtdevelopment it was proposed to have a fallback environment variable setconfigfile a generated default value based on qstandardpaths org name app name binary name etc there was a to this suggestion and no dissent
1254,why this should be a problem attr is a local to this thread storage nobody else will see that
1255,gerrit tells me off if the commit subject is too long w commit subject characters use shorter first paragraph but does the go project really care
1256,backed away from that it is simply impractical too many tools and users use to remove support for it
1257,thought i was already using the guava files class in the same file but i guess that was only true in the test file done
1258,static bugzillarestcreatetaskschema.getfieldnamefromattributename and add an immutablemap
1259,class should be for launch specific utilities but i agree with you it makes sense to consolidate until it becomes unwieldy
1260,ok let me explain a bit the usbip is split into two parts on the server side theres an userspace daemon usbipd and a kernel module usbiphost.ko the client has a userspace tool usbip and a virtual usb hcd vhcihcd.ko so get_usbip_message_len is split in the same manner the device list import stuff which has a protocl version is the user space portion the usbiphost.ko and vhcihcd.ko part aka urbs handling version is part of the kernel you are right ill add comment which explains why the function got so convoluted
1261,set i would prefer that you didnt submit this this bug is a duplicate of and will be handled in URL after discussing the correct behavior is to allow diskless templates so this patch is no longer relevant please abandon it sorry for the hassle
1262,tvb_ip_to_str that should eliminate the need for
1263,personally hate this commands should not go to a redirected file i think your redirect options should be off on verbose and only verbose should add commands
1264,is bbox supposed to be encoded for transmission over http currently its encoded as a javascript array which is probably why its not behaving as expected
1265,explain on why it is been taken out from the switch case below
1266,newline
1267,not really liking this name maybe just resources
1268,can address it in a separate commit but i rather use only one approach for the compaction instead of having a sorted compaction as an option sorting will be expensive especially when we have a large number of items if we dont have not much performance gain i rather use an unsorted option
1269,wonder why jetbrains repeats this code in all their bundles
1270,good to me i shall handle these changes in the separate patch thanks
1271,isnt a very good function name i assume that it doesnt initialize everything in memcached init_allocation_hooks would probably be a better name
1272,agree that we should follow master for this and projects like ctk but it is better explicitly update sha with commits otherwise upstream can update at any point and builds or tests will mysteriously start failing also when checking out branches or tags we will get the versions of ctk etc that are known to work with that of tubetk
1273,document these is_precise is we know the exact type would exact be clearer
1274,now believe that all paths have already done a finishsweep by this point so removing this as you did is correct
1275,logical as opposed to what its all logical in software leave away how about loading is controlled by this dependency graph
1276,think you can use here getandsetvdsstatic to get the vds name so we will have it in the log i think it is called anyway for the logging infrastructure finish
1277,the purpose of this change do we really need this in the patch
1278,is a weird format it wont close twice actually and its not to handle the exception there is an infinite loop from l1537 to l1581 in each iteration it opens the zipfile before getting into another iteration it needs to close the zipfile ive moved l1583 inside the loop to make it less weird
1279,EMO_NEG so we need to either port this file over to kernel style or not use gotos since we started it before everyone decided kernel style was ok weve been using a hackeddown google style which forbids goto
1280,to megumis nit consider initializing the value to true and possibly collapsing these two methods down to one with an argument
1281,can remove these functions now and use logcat_text_dump_open in dump routines in file_access.c
1282,we have a working solution if one still need the gerritmodule
1283,can add bitmasks to the hf_ item and still use proto_tree_add_item to get your desired effect
1284,nit pref eliminate if just return the boolean evaluation
1285,is not something that we would want to call out in ui as users may not understand what it is about please use the expanded form in all cases
1286,about just moving it to requestfactorytestbase instead of a toplevel class
1287,is nearly true glusterds connection management and nlm glusternfs uses USER_MENTION different than i am removing USER_MENTION from the argument list
1288,thats funny d good that you payed attention done
1289,change here reminds me that also some of the new oc opcodes may need an entry here could you take care of those in a followup patch
1290,a quick question if we are not creating the volfile whats the outcome
1291,this an optional call or clients should always call it at the end when is it a good idea to call unmount can we add this info to some form of documentation
1292,confuse algorithm with implementation env is not supposed to be used this way as its touched from different places it was said many times that using env to pass data between different codepaths is a bad idea
1293,really dislike modifying unrelated code all around all this is going to give us is merge conflicts youre not even consistent you left unchanged
1294,is the same argument that we want positive constants for time constants
1295,are you using cerr here instead of vtkerrormacro
1296,indent shouldnt it be slerp instead of slerp cant change the cast of acronyms
1297,not put this in begin so that all subclasses will have the trxfname logic
1298,include a warning if the assumption is not met
1299,move command to system.py so this can be reduced to cmd_node_init
1300,understand you do this so that gf_free under the out label does not free the acl_xattr the dict_unref will call gf_free already is there a need for gf_free in out at all i think that only is useful for the error case when dict_set_bin failed it would be cleaner and easier to understand if you do the above in the if ret statements there is no need for this acl_xattr null then anymore if you do not like that approach or if i missed something that makes it impractical this acl_xattr null stetment desperately needs a comment
1301,so should we keep this as local or change to mergestrategies
1302,happen if groups were imported to an institution different from mahara
1303,but then i suggest you turn that thing into a macro which you can document centrally qt_segmented_string_literal or so also a warning in the qstringliteral doc would be in order if its not there yet
1304,patch and please use a tab for consistency a separate patch could unify that too i guess
1305,it make it easier to override if we return a list that way if someone wants to add an adapter they could simply add to the list instead of copying the array this method is used in an enhanced for loop so a list would work just as well as an array
1306,from michael pergament author of this code EMO_NEG it should be according to URL if it is smaller than neither ipv4 not ipv6 address is provided
1307,you add a bit of documentation in the docstring
1308,do these section come from the linker feeling clever
1309,will change the style of link that gitweb creates when it outputs html to the client if a site wants the non pathinfo style leaving this enabled would defeat that setting
1310,is specified to be characters while the original version broke that by adding a space i guess its simply ignored with this change the final m would be dropped too when you fix that also cut oemid to characters its acpi5.0
1311,and optional cleanup i think we can drop support for at this point both here and in maglinkre
1312,what the commit does add release notes apply css only to content formatting fix if you want to put an id put it in the body and using the git sha of the previously merged commit is better so it works on both github etc and gerrit
1313,we can assume that because the if statement above checks to see what extensions are enabled if the config option has a single entry in the list all that means all extensions are supposed to be enabled on nova i just chose hosts here because i wanted an extension that problem wasnt ever going to be removed also one that wasnt many characters
1314,can probably be removed if the suggestions for performok and performapply are implemented
1315,angle brackets for headers not provided by us
1316,return value of null doesnt look right it means even in the presence of failures it will still reboot into recovery mode and show no command to users dont have a fix in mind though
1317,you want to save the three characters urn not worth it imo EMO_POS
1318,from sys_openbsd_386s.s and missed fixed EMO_POS
1319,this check before fetching the translations above in the elsebranch you then set to array maybe initialise it to an empty array as the first line of this function as in functions before and only fetch translations when needed here
1320,does not return a date serial number it returns a formatted number with yymmdd see how ndate is stored in init which is returned by getdate
1321,version or version provided by the system
1322,a whitespace when assigning
1323,then theres no need to redefine the gwtmavenplugins dependencies so either we use as the gwtmavenplugin version and we remove the plugin dependencies or we keep it that way with identical but unrelated versions for gwt and the gwtmavenplugin id happily go with the former which would simplify the pom and aligns with what people should write unless they really need different versions of gwt and the plugin e.g they use a patched gwt or a patched plugin or the plugin hasnt yet been released for the version of gwt they want to use or the plugin has had a bugfix release but it makes it a bit harder to test the webappcreator with a gwt rc not yet pushed to central where the plugin hasnt yet been released because it cannot update its gwt dependencies yet wdyt
1324,think this fits better as an overload in unloggedfailure
1325,a proper sentence and this routine does more than that returning encoded version
1326,agree with thomas we should benchmark if it doesnt make a measurable difference we should get rid of the customization if thats the only reason for us to have this file i expect by now more time has been spent optimizing the jdks hashmap than has been spent on com.google.gwt.dev.util.collect.hashmap EMO_POS
1327,not simply do groupseparatorspinbox
1328,are missing schema upgrade and schemaversion see for example this change URL
1329,can pass in ret as errno to gf_msg also this can be a new msgid dht_msg_open_fd_on_dst_failed
1330,null would have been even clearer here
1331,if you move this line below then you dont have to comment out the line below
1332,guess the big question is whether it is sufficient to test the functionality by mocking out getaddrinfo or if we need to actually make the call if the former i think it could go in ut lets see what others say
1333,convention is to have all mappers static in order to reduce their instantiations as they have no state please extract it into a private static class
1334,whats wrong with using new
1335,for fixing it what if the author disagrees with your negative vote and writes a reply to your comment explaining why he disagrees if this change is filtered out there is a high chance to you miss this reply but with this argumentation it is even more dangerous for me how it was originally why i am maintainer and have power of i review a change and decide to put my veto on it but we all do mistakes we all have feelings in the end we are all people what is if it was a wrong veto the contributor try to explain me in additional comments why he thinks the veto was wrong and that the impact of the change is minimal and that thousands of people from hundreds of companies cant upgrade to the new version of the product and all that because of his veto nothing helps why because i used your dashboard template put this line and this change was filtered out
1336,much matter either way lets omit from the list of tested attributes with all clang except on windows
1337,cant parse the part between this comma and the next one
1338,introduce new types unless you truly need them they are supposed to be equivalence classes and the more you define the larger the policy will grow gs4 policy has significant bloat due to unnecessary types that get the same allow rules as existing types
1339,set liron so lets think reconstruct flow go throught all vds refresh and on case of some exception connect recovery flow go through all vds connect and after that refresh no need for exception handling on case of exception at refresh especially additional refresh no need for additional method that u introduced where it is percent common you already introduced a method that at some flow should return only true and complicated a very simple code right now there is no need to copy the method in my opinion your change at connectandrefreshalluphosts in order to solve bug at reconstruct flow caused to regression in recovery flow i dont think that these means common
1340,set codereview1 USER_MENTION yeah we already discussed that but since we dont have time to implement promises or similar for its still better than before so for now we make sure to fetch the stuff early but i agree we should add a todo in there
1341,use gboolean here and for the return value and etc since that appears to be how this is actually used
1342,should be like below textdirection swt.auto_text_direction
1343,there a way to edit the commenteditabletime i havent spotted one
1344,sorry d order these
1345,think you could indent this line another four spaces if you want
1346,has different purpose if scale is less than equal to we will not perform transaltion if the device doesnt support multi touch we need not go into this block and skip the execution of the next six lines hence it was added here
1347,be here or anywhere see my comment below re select
1348,doc comments are inheritted from the parent
1349,feel like these explanatory comments belong in the code not just the code review
1350,let peter decide what he wants to email but changed the subject to include the host name
1351,assumed you didnt care about modifying the callers array because resources srcs modifies resources inplace as well yay python so you should fix that below also typically in python we strongly discourage mutable default arugments
1352,to initpropertyproviders and also in recompile_lib
1353,was actually the original code if dest src and youre only copying one byte at a time if you start from the top youll never overwrite the data you havent copied yet otherwise you have to start from the other end memcpy but memcpy is not to quote from the pretty short man page the memory areas must not overlap thats the difference between memcpy and memmove if there was no overlap at all which we could check for then you could use memcpy and that would make the normal case work like it always has but im working on a change to add optimized versions of memmove for x86 and arm in order to test them im going to implement them in the chromeos tree and then to transfer them over ive put together a big series of patches to upstream so they should just apply
1354,remove this comment here the require once is obsolete only
1355,would have put all this in a separate config file like we do in the other plugins
1356,add constant for test_other_dc_id it is confusing youre using the test_network_id
1357,the calls to append stringbuilder msg new stringbuilder not find the at this location provide alternative url
1358,isnt EMO_NEG URL
1359,the deprecation log here is not finally discussed im for not logging because the deprecation log will get extremely flooded when enabling only the first setting and not all three should be logged to minimize the flood the logging could be enabled in the next version and till then it should be documented very well
1360,if you want to compare from a raw byte array used to serialize object ids
1361,messages dont have description in messagesqq.php or
1362,seems like a rather meaningless class name i wonder if we should move away from it to something more meaningful
1363,there a function for this query already or should we make one for future it is just that this is quite a big block of code and would be more readable factored out
1364,worth including the regular version number too
1365,this line is removed the rdescription parameter name and only the name needs to be commented out because otherwise in an enablewerror build the build breaks with unused variable
1366,USER_MENTION everywhere it was possible
1367,was done for binary files to be stored in earlier formats encountering such versions isnt the case anymore with and conversion would never be executed so that code could be removed along with the check if you want you can remove that code in a followup patch getting rid of unused code is always good EMO_POS probably the reason why you had to add the check if a version is set at all is related to that actually the stream should have the version soffice_fileformat_current set so all parts involved elsewhere that do check the version get that correct would be nice if you could spot the place where that should be done anyhow ill push the current patch as is
1368,about jigals comment copying an array for the sake of a variable name is a waste of resources imo
1369,come there is change for io resources with config option of
1370,two variables were defined separately in the previous version now that you need them in every method you could just declare them at the first utilization applies to the other methods too
1371,point i missed that determinism is a key feature fixed
1372,question on sideeffects as on the previous file
1373,agree with markus if only for codeconsistency purposes add the it is bad karma anyway to have arguments with default values preceding ones without a default value
1374,the indentation is wrong EMO_POS however the main question is if the assignments should be aligned in a line or if a single space would be enough indentation
1375,parameter pinfo
1376,code after return statement cannot be executed
1377,selection count note lowercase c is better this is the string displayed in the status bar
1378,question do you want me to declare the revtree variables before
1379,refreshing of the mergeable state is already implemented in i would prefer to have the code only in one place
1380,before missing causes reoccurring changes proposed by database analyzer in installer
1381,column names shouldnt be in curly brackets because that adds the dbprefix and we only want that on the table names
1382,was intended to be modes from the start but could not be fixed before without braking bc should probably go as a separate commit
1383,each sensor have its own filterable field i think thats what i was trying to determine and came up with yes i believe some are common and share evtype_rvals but i thought others have difference enumerations dont necessarily want to share a field name just because the enumeration is shared
1384,of presence of dataparsoid this is not a new block level image title or test needs editing
1385,but how about defining skipontest if z then else echo skipping it should be added to ovirt_store_config in case the test happens to be run on ovirtnode
1386,like here its too late to set the response status when im reaching this code im getting warn org.eclipse.jetty.server.httpchannel java.lang.illegalstateexception committed at at at at at at at at at
1387,dont think most of these are necessary the dissector is and should be organized to just define functions before they are used
1388,not do dict_get_str and use the ptr to find the index that will avoid more book keeping
1389,will need to log the error since it is ignored by caller
1390,issue declare variables as close to the first use as possible
1391,or less the same steps as described in the comment sep am change URL can you try it with non existing h2 database
1392,left intentionally like that so that a patch that actually enables one lfp looks cleaner
1393,set the for now as it may also contain internal errors i would leave the code path in couchdb for dealing with it though so that i can add it later
1394,set although already merged i dont think this is the right solution currently the behavior of the permissions system tcemain and thus also all other components is to use checklanguageaccess only if the tca for the table has a languagefield pages is not such a table because there is pages_language_overlay so the current integrators solution to restrict a user not to be able to edit the original language is to remove the permissions for editing table pages and only allow pages_language_overlay see also URL this is not what is being done in the patch but instead you simply check for checklanguageaccess similar problem we have in the list view as the context menu provides more options i.e for content elements than really permitted permission check in tcemain is more aggressive than in the gui correct solution for this particular fix would be to check if user has edit permissions on the pages table just like tcemain also does as this is confusing for integrators in general i would rather propose that someone thinks about a better approach on language restriction permissions on pages in the first place before fixing the gui i am undecided still if we should revert this merge but i am currently pretty sure we should not backport that to maybe in your research you find out different aspects than i did or you can prove me wrong as i have only touched the surface of the whole complex please let me know
1395,would suggest changing the name of this we actually use neutron drivers for spec reviews confusing i know given line below since each of these has its own review team perhaps we can somehow indicate that here
1396,is the default why isnt the default to use all available cores this is the default for mdrun and also the default behavior of openmp
1397,when you copy a manifest object the new object is a normal object not a copy of the manifest instead it is a concatenation of all the segment objects this means that you cannot copy objects larger than in size all metadata is preserved during the object copy if you specify metadata on the request to copy the object either the put or the copy the metadata overwrites any conflicting keys on the target new object
1398,the version be changed now that some methods are not available
1399,a nice feature does it cause a particular problem
1400,about same in doc string itd be more safe to remove this method altogether
1401,believe you can only have one appender configured the file based one is more useful to me but maybe not to others
1402,whole last block from line to could be simplified to return skipiflastmatched null skipiflastmatched cache.lastmatched
1403,is my update of this help page URL it should also link to expert config page but it does not exist yet
1404,do not use whitespace before cc EMO_NEG style use a single space after cc EMO_NEG style unrecognized email address
1405,it is a bug in adb no ambiguity here but its really subtle so itd be nice to have a better description of the problem its not really python specific as you mention i.e something like some programs want to launch an adb command and collect its output by calling createprocess with inheritable handles then using read to get its output when this happens the handles passed to the adb client process will also be inheritable when starting the adb server here care must be taken to reset them to noninheritable otherwise something bad happens even if the adb command completes the calling process is stuck while from the descriptors because theyre connected to corresponding handles in the adb server process even if the latter never to them the proc_thread_attribute_handle_list isnt directly related to the problem and not needed in this specific case because i dont think there are multiple threads being used in the adb client process at least when reaching this code its probably better to avoid mentioning it or add a note like ideally use proc_thread_attribute_handle_list if running on vista or higher
1406,disagree i dont think that would shorten the code by much
1407,we can file a bug against android or just fix it and submit a patch
1408,seemed to be triggered too hurly so im not sure that actually work
1409,want to make this if
1410,should now depend on a python_library that contains
1411,seems confusing to me it reads like if enosys is returned on the iteration then fmr is not supported which gave me the impression that enosys can be returned in later iterations too in which case it does not indicate fmr is not supported rather please consider if rc enosys device does not support fmr break
1412,only replacing them in the copy of the string that gets written to fo were returning the original string i guess parse is just misleading were copying to the tmp file and rewriting one particular entry but returning the original of what we just overwrote
1413,all of this into a static helper method that returns a already configured for the sun jndi names used below then we only need a map for connection pooling as an instance member
1414,will add a value on top of the above line will replace any previous value with this one not sure which effect the author is looking for but i personally dont understand why youd want to have several download.scheme variables
1415,is a global config option fro the core filter not a per hypervisor setting
1416,have audio_data_file and so this can be changed to that
1417,a comment before this test explaining what its trying to test
1418,are many times mds if the client does not umount then there will recovery waiting every time the mds which is unnecessary for this test
1419,we need to add a special check to make sure the last model bucket is counted in the last scaled index without going out of bounds
1420,cherrypick restapi acts on revisions e.g patchsets not changes just like the review restapi does hence i dont think that it should go into changeapi look at the resturl and you will see it differs quite from the other restful commands in changeapi if you still want me to add it to changeapi i can do that but this is how i reasoned about where to put it
1421,you instead put this into the gerritserver directory you can then refactor the adminsetparent sshd command to also use this implementation that would reduce the amount of code needed to add this feature since its mostly just extracting the existing code from adminsetparent
1422,ports and other more exotic configs now have their own section that ive added in this commit
1423,you please update the same in clicmdsnapshot.c
1424,possible incorrect use of applerelated terminology
1425,think we should make it very clear that this is an asynchronous process enqueues a clean up of old cache files
1426,would love to do this the problem is that all ssh information is only available inside of the ssh project and the server project which implements the rest endpoints doesnt have a dependency on it since we dont want this dependency i dont know how to implement it on the other hand if you have ssh enabled and you are interested in the ssh summary and connections you can retrieve this information via ssh the rest endpoints are mainly important for installations where ssh is not available but in this case there is also no ssh summary and no ssh connections this is why im okay with the current solution of ignoring the ssh stuff in the rest endpoint
1427,remove empty line in middle of variable declaration and convert few lines after to tabs
1428,happens if the specified branch doesnt exist will that be caught by the check at line
1429,want to keep it for now there might be new where we suddenly realize it would be useful having them in config.h.cmakein is a reasonable compromise to remember we can use them although they arent selectable directly in cmake for the moment
1430,thinks thats the wrong one the one that should be from is the pl library
1431,remark here please write here why this routine does it
1432,have caught this earlier ret would be reset to here on succesful cleanup of source but actual migration may want to signal a failure with ret as so we would need to use a different variable or reset ret to its original
1433,is an apachemod_phpism not a guaranteed feature standard php anywhere else does not include that handling youre going to have to explain how you expect redirected from from a http redirect would be handled because so far everyone whos attempted to turn redirect pages into http redirects while preserving redirected from properly has failed
1434,replaceto will need to use the newly to be created langid value same as for bo_cn are the codes verbatim copied from dz_bt in which case only a would be needed or arent some needed to be adapted to in country conventions
1435,bad i did add one but then removed it again and forgot to change that line back
1436,cant guarantee there wont be two pipeline running concurrently for one replication
1437,this is here by purpose to document that this is a static method as that is not otherwise evident without looking at the header
1438,the flag package is ideally only imported in main where did this notion of ideal come from the advice i usually hear and give is dont register flags except from the main package because youre mutating a global variable this utility function doesnt touch any global variables isnt its purpose pretty obvious from the usage example above
1439,mind found it in notification_internal_activity EMO_POS will see what i can do
1440,it was not added as part of this patch but ill fix it hopefully well be able to completely get rid of these parameters
1441,add more tests on this conf file when you add the rest of the code
1442,would you remove it please keep gid_file_bin_unpackupdate untouched
1443,you checked that this change is not breaks other tests
1444,not sure if i understand why it should not pick as first
1445,we miss adding the server if the status change command failed on it i guess we should add it if it fails with already enabled error not sure what we should do if there is some other error though maybe we should let the sync job handle such cases
1446,in case of invalid argument the process gets started fine its just that it gets immediately exited afterwards see line
1447,it looks like gerrit missing a feature remove comments that dont make any sense like these below EMO_POS thanks for the hint with java_library and resource
1448,got the idea for adding such a message from your change only you had it even more verbose adding a message per approval that was copied i can try to incorporate this into the patch set created message but not sure if this is easily possible
1449,part of this log as gf_msg will do it when errno is passed
1450,set i would prefer that you didnt submit this inline comments i dont see the need for this change if you built with the ebuild unmodified youd get an image.bin which would be what you want as far as i could tell looking at the new function its identical to the old one except that youre leaving out the original image.bin the difference between image.bin and image.rw.bin is that cros_bundle_firmware is being passed the forcerw option in one case and not in the other what that does is it changes the way parts of the image are put together so that vboot doesnt allow the ro only optimization even if the ro firmware claims it supports it the ro only optimization is where you run the whole firmware out of ro instead of jumping into an rw copy partway through if you really dont want to enable that optimization you can not pass that flag to vboot when running vbinit even if you do want to split things out like this it would be better to take the existing depthcharge function and to selectively build the ro image based on a use flag independent of whether splitting things up is a good idea if mike who knows bash much better than i do i think likes the style of the new function youve made it would be nice to incorporate the style changes back into the original function
1451,those need to be enabled on as asneeded basis kconfig knows about sse and its ilk noted will take care of it
1452,after successful otherwise the detail message will be appended directly onto it without any space
1453,think we should hardcode the status since the user can only subscribe
1454,is no point in defining those private static variables we could just use the string literal directly in the methods it was like that originally because the original definitions were public static finals we then switched to methods so that they could be overriden
1455,robert i think this should be not as its not defined at this point thanks ghada
1456,set greg thanks for the info i agree with your assessment on caching as well
1457,lengths seems like most of these would be easier to read if they were placed on the preceding line before the variables
1458,still trying to understand what this new logic brings to the table after all of this effort we are still just enforcing that the that created an entity is the same one that can perform operations on that entity however the database relationships used in the entity queries enforce this so what does all of this do that is different if we were doing attributelevel access control it might make more sense to me but entity level for tenantid rbac is redundant to the db queries to me
1459,think youre right that this seems only natural i will leave the code for this commented out by a flag for now and figure out a way to add a lint mode to jsorestrictionschecker later to warn when turned on
1460,delete this line have one empty line in between the background and the scenario
1461,nightmares about empty lines kidnapping you in an alien ship and performing colonoscopy
1462,wouldnt recommend to use a percentage here with this change is backwardscompatible most of the time or this does not change the public api we should be on the safe side
1463,are still several rows for the distinct blocks and up to one separate row with no related block element so we still need the gorup by clause
1464,works pretty well and provides status information for impatient users note that nrms is a shared variable among the threads and that the line is overprint with the carriage return character in a fifo manner
1465,set looks good to me but someone else must approve would wonder about chattr during runtime but yeah youre likely right assuming this has been image tested too
1466,the methods of this class are only called from the request handler worker thread then i think locking is not necessary a comment describing which member variables the mutex is protecting would be helpful see the comment in the header file
1467,please dont reformat these comment blocks
1468,ian i was not aware of this created
1469,an extra header file the definitions can go directly to settings.cxx
1470,dont get it how are those unused locks got rid of
1471,explicitly returns a yeah its the same as a null maybe that should be changed to return a null but at this point i think checking for is reasonable yes if its we still reach the code ive changed it to not dereference it before checking it though
1472,does not modify the oustring but returns a new oustring instead this means that when converting an existing string call you need to assign the returned value to the original string you should get a warning about an unused result here but strangely im not seeing a warning with gcc no idea why at least the clang tinderbox caught the problem fixed in commit
1473,want the next item to be dequeued when the previously dequeued item has been consumed by the caller as there is no facility to enqueue an item again so i am using the unbuffered channel for this synchronization
1474,uses this method i dont see why this is useful id just get rid of this method and the associated field once you do that you can just collapse this class into a single static method runall and get rid of the pair class
1475,think i have addressed this in the updated version too
1476,would replace this line by as is associate array with key id
1477,its not leaving the dob blank means you just choose not to fill it in as the field itself is not compulsory
1478,repeats the name of the test better use convert as the other tests if you think it is more clear change all the tests probably in another patch
1479,i was suggesting flipping the boolean i did also wonder whether we wouldnt be better off just passing in the length if its interpret that as dont know that would then move down out of the callers too or i really like the way you went for readfully rather than implementing the missing which is what id actually imagined how about we go one further and just have a static fromfile or similar then it could do the stat and have everything it needs you could even use libcore.os to avoid the randomaccessfile without increasing the overall amount of code
1480,sure why all these if statements are necessary see the definition for optional_str on line
1481,numberofthreads
1482,remove this log its a part of the if below
1483,you move a host to maintenance then that calls disconnectstorageserver which should remove this definition so in general this shouldnt affect anything negatively the case where this would remain is in case of an error flow where for some reason it wasnt disconnected properly or something even if that happens its not that interesting as a few leftover connections shouldnt affect the host negatively think about fc where the host is always connected the advantage is that most of the time since hosts dont move between dcs very often the host would automatically reconnect whenever it reboots e.g due to sanlock fencing and it would be available to engine almost immediately reducing recovery time imo that is more important see ovirt bug after a reboot of both engine and vdsm domains take a long time minutes to recover
1484,what is this misterious newly to be created langid value ive put but im not sure
1485,todo will have to wait for a later bug fix because its used when users belong to multiple institutions the progress bar gives them a menu to determine which institution to show and that relies on the param its not a security issue having this it just allows users to see what the completion goals are for other institutions theyre not members of
1486,the way why are you adding patches for specific platform blah
1487,think its more common in java to treat abbreviations as words when in an identifier name so benchmarkresultjson please apply throughout
1488,should have a space and uppercase the first letter like in the other comments
1489,set fails inline comment i just tried this change on tot gavd on my waluigi and it didnt detect headphone insertion i went back to just tot the change renaming udev_listen udev_sound and it does work i know the commands for alsa were not flushed out yet in the max98095 codec is that the problem right now
1490,cant this go int qtypeinfo i would like to have it there to enable some feature of qweakpointer only for qobject for example
1491,bugfix what is the bug number the comment is as helpful as it could be EMO_POS if there is a fix for this but not enough time to test best to let future programmer know where to look
1492,there is only one developer path do not append to the xcode name it looks weird
1493,we have a copy of fiemap and a pointer fiemap which one is the right one
1494,agree that a trailing or is missing here though defining a function is_configured and putting the greps in it would have been better than any commenting i cannot say that i like duplicating bash logic in english
1495,wondering if and cache can be factored somehow with a common helper
1496,we have a single definition of such constants EMO_POS perhaps some org.ovirt.engine.ui.uicommonweb.stringconstants class
1497,isnt a link to mysql done think of these requirements are redundant and already covered in the general installation section the jdk is but tomcat isnt
1498,makes sense that this is for the iommu since family model xx are the only parts that support it
1499,seems to me to be the case there is a bug URL shertz probably knows more about it
1500,is per loc_handle which is changelog_catalog handle this should remain here and set per each mdt catalog but not per whole context
1501,time_sec_to_str format the field better than an ft_uint16 or does it just add an s to the value which you may want to keep for consistency
1502,problem might be if youre running cmake outside git repository dist package
1503,guess above versioning should be updated since api changed
1504,dont think this is ever defined on android its a bsd thing
1505,its unclear how i missed it buck targets show_output done
1506,think there should be a maximum size and scrolling should start from there with options there would be a good case for implementing a tabstructure in the dialog
1507,namedtuple is a newstyle class otherwise wont fly for it note that shows that it uses by default so im all for the removal of this redundant line however the commit message is confusing
1508,sorry about missing the indirection heres the example cbfs in memory has in it which would then be passed back to map
1509,is done now the regex will now not be applied on some invalid versions where it was before some types of invalid versions will still match the regex though that is outside of the concerns of this function it is not a version number validator after all
1510,user might still want to disable it unlike the other options this one does not need a pirq_table.c or mptable.c file be sitting around generally dropping these tables from the build is almost never worth it since most oses expect something there
1511,will then await your next patch set before continuing review of this and followup changes
1512,is distro specific perhaps make it clear that this is an example and that other systems would be installed differently
1513,another patchset be pushed please change the leading blanks to tabs
1514,is confusing i think this needs to be called pluggableprefix or something of that nature to call it service is confusing to me
1515,think i was playing too safe here we can probably just bound it to stackmode native regardless of sdm
1516,wed need to fix grompp since it wrote this file EMO_POS
1517,it is used below in g_list_foreach where gpointer is mandated
1518,the followup change this method is renamed to caneditchangelabels i would propose to name it already here caneditchangelabels so that it doesnt need to be renamed in the next change URL URL
1519,can open as many issue tickets as you like but we would still have to add all these tests in here and find solution that fit them why delay
1520,add here copyright c ibm corporation and others
1521,is the floating image in license stops the bottom margin working ive added in a cb div and added some margin top to the feedback box
1522,have that around many classes this way now if i recall correctly we have not guideline for this would you be fine with keeping it this way if so please merge
1523,i guess i forgot to type make after fixing that anyway i finished my commits review in the meantime too
1524,table of function pointers sounds good right about now
1525,not clear to me what this really does given b c does this create c as a file or an empty directory the name dir suggests the latter but the comment seems to suggest the former
1526,agree this can be discovered without the text deleted the comment same in openkey
1527,will cause a double free the previous gf_ref_put will already call auth_cache_entry_free where entry is freed if auth_cache_add has failed
1528,we agree to always treat a single number as json even if the client doesnt enable datatype support then we can always set its datatype to json regardless of that
1529,globals please if at all possible but more generally this is a base class please stick specific functionality into derived classes you already did that in slidefragmenthandler for parts of it for ppt_token text when it comes in the slidefragmenthandler context just generate a new child context e.g like new slidetimingcontext in that file with that you will get rid of that global state anyway
1530,sql_fetch_assoc and sql_fetch_row should default to false initialize default output to false for sql_fetch_assoc and sql_fetch_row
1531,set i would prefer that you didnt submit this hi ananth i agree with markus that im in favor of not merging this what xml parser ate you using that is not capable of empty closing tags esp if you set the html tendering mode to xhtml the output is a subset of xml if you need to have empty closing tags replaced by q dedicated closing tag for a special use case you could ask on URL to figure out a solution for you im confident that its possible however i would not change typo3s default behavior thanks for your understanding yours steffen
1532,should be called with client list lock held instead of osc lock
1533,this be simplified inline to rebalance_completed please note rebalance_completed has a bug you should only check for completed status instead of inversing for in progress
1534,ca use directly val_to_str on hf
1535,update this at URL
1536,gives the target article title but in the apply function its looked up by href which may be a redirect title
1537,good catch funny this slipped in btw arrayutility from extbase should be reviewed and at first glance it seems most of it could be merged to core arrayutility
1538,should be some separation of code from the rest of the text even if its clear that its a url to ensure that nobody gets the idea to translate it may be enough but having quotes too is a good idea
1539,is pretty inconsitent some have very short descriptions like this one others only point to the jdk doc which is what i will do big todo update all url pointers
1540,cant make changes directly to oojs directly here you need to check out the oojs repos make changes there and once they are merged create a separate change which updates this concatenated file then you can rebase onto that change
1541,like calling rather than inline policyconditional code i dont like that i have still exposed policyspecifics in line newest_file durable_file or data_file or ts_file i nearly changed this to pass the ondisk file set to is_obsolete and let that method take care of a determining the policyspecific newest file and then b determining if the file under test is obsolete but backed off because there would be a slight loss of optimisation because as it stands the loop is never executed if there is newest file i guess a call to a would do it but what id really like to do is have a policy.get_ondisk_files method return the wanted set and optionally the unwanted set as result of a single iteration over the dir listing
1542,dont want to change the actual messages in this change for reasons stated above
1543,name this installtodispatcher or something like that i had a hard time understanding all the different classes
1544,checked and git does not clear the environment to run hooks i also cant find subversions reasoning around clearing it so barring finding out that theres a good reason to i think ill just remove this line
1545,my company this is a rule to put the constant before a variable for comparison this rule avoid also to forget a in operator and to create a bug you can retrieve this rule in esf URL we think that the same work could be interesting with papyrus
1546,do we handle the is that just included in the objs
1547,code is broken needs to be changed
1548,enough but still deleting registry entries is wrong you wont be able to run that program again without them you can disable service from inside your program too URL
1549,dont care about the number of instances of referenceindex i want to have this cache inside which is static
1550,i think spaces around are preferred in gerrits code base
1551,have create_port function with build in cleanup its better to use it
1552,should wrap the following code into a and close the pdb when you are done with it
1553,just not correct to skip in osp because it doesnt know whether this is a stripe or just regular directory which we can access via osp
1554,remove the word magic from this file too edit the file git commit amend git gerritpush thanks
1555,use hard coded type names
1556,is a comma missing after
1557,happens if a leap2a imports doesnt have any children at the path should we check to see if the exist and fall back to if they dont
1558,seems to me that we have a more serious issue here
1559,tried to avoid include the large block in if else endif EMO_POS and does this change break mips our change will not impact mips
1560,is in the wrong place and will cause multiple prints per class when running in parallel moves variables to unittest result object utresult.mapping.var moves to utresult.var however the vars arent being used so it does not do anything the dump_results handles printing of the results for the parallel version and as such needs to be updated to achieve what you are looking for
1561,actually fear that php accepts this due to some easteregg or so EMO_POS
1562,guess its because hasrole only returns boolean and the array key is needed as well
1563,should be just authentication required to make the message consistent with other rest endpoints
1564,people really type all that junk EMO_POS anyway i added it together with how to avoid typing all that junk EMO_POS
1565,have a potential problem here with mmconf_support this option indicates hardware has pcie config register access in mmio space in addition to the legacy io registers a second option mmconf_support_default is not set so by default you would use pci io config access but since those are nonatomic smi handler in i82801ix explicitly uses mmio and you have no mmconf_base_address set
1566,forse download forse scaricamenti
1567,parts rely on nonnull values perhaps this should be critical anyway lets not expand preconditions beyond jre for now and submit the patchset that i already
1568,is unnecessary rather document why this is done if necessary
1569,should have a log for nonconnect events as well probably at trace or debug levels
1570,phpdoc states that an array is returned would it be better to return an array instead of null
1571,on strings need to use version comparator i just added comment so it will get fixed
1572,simple_strtoul is obsolete use kstrtoul instead
1573,ive changed the method name to validate not sure though if its worth the effort to change the already existing listeners
1574,matters we use tabs and trailing whitespace has to be removed
1575,we are changing the default to but in open it is we should have only one i think was chosen based on what python os module does but could be wrong
1576,please add a comment here like include for dirname
1577,will unfortunately only work if there are no intel xeons that work in dualsocket configuration because we could confuse a workstation that has two such processors with an xeon e5 in singlesocket configuration
1578,checked other comments and there where no such annotation
1579,should be done without of the editor just by checking the mapping
1580,need to enter in this if block only in case of unknown protocol so when dissector_try_heuristic return value is
1581,think the expert info should point to the end_marker field itself replace message_tree with tiem
1582,entries are added to the under the but not client entries xprt entries are added to the list during handshake i suppose in server_rpc_notify post that in server_setvolume we create client entry and assign it to transport object xprt so there could be scenarios where in we have an entry in xprt_list without client associated
1583,dont hijack other chipsets i82801gx is ich7 not nm10
1584,understand that right not only root is supported by engine but i prefer that the api layer will pass to the engine all the information that the user provided engine may choose to ignore for now all users aside for root the way its written here is just a bug waiting to happen tomorrow engine will support other users and suddenly we will have a bug in the api some users are not passed on to the engine for some reason
1585,the model about logs as the class name suggests or about log rows as the parameter name suggests at least one of them needs to be changed
1586,all projects are imported or that it imports all projects
1587,it that wasnt supposed to be there ill remove it
1588,so at very least you should only patch set part if ref starts with refs_changes if at all it already does this startindex checks for the prefix
1589,forget too specific code for containers and edit parts
1590,the goto you must update errcode what happens now is that we fall to alloc_error label and then return a success status when actually an error happened and was not populated
1591,field if sshdaddress is used consistently
1592,just used take_snapshot of the patched upstream repo but the commit message could be clearer about this
1593,there are two functions here please check and reupload the patch for review
1594,comment as above use wmem_map_new with file scope memory
1595,notification sounds like a id say thats somewhat misleading so id name that with something indicating the progress bar
1596,the same vein of getting the classs metadata_type when deserializing the response since you are checking if the metadata_type is located in the json_dict you could reference the classs metadata_type directly i should have seen this in the last code review if driverinfo.metadata_type in json_dict the same applies for the properties keyword check in line
1597,you are already the nat gateway in so no one else should be using gateway address anyway im fine with please just add a comment to explain why its EMO_POS
1598,this place is fixed to contain should the other fd also be fixed to use
1599,i did not closely looked into log date part thanks for this patch
1600,dont believe so i was using it but because we have messages that can be one byte long such as a keepalive and some messages that require as much as bytes to determine others i needed something more flexible

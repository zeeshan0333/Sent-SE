1,thanks ning
2,i meant zookeeper1239
3,ted matteo thanks for the review the commands.rb has some existing logic that tries to rescue some exceptions it will get more and more difficult to keep it generic artificially as we evolve and add more the approach to expand instead of shrink this logic is not a bad or ugly one but your suggested solution is fine
4,to both of you and to deepesh for the initiative
5,just committed this thanks steven
6,willem sorry i was trying to get to the wiki but its been a busy week
7,an attachment mimeinput.eml for this test case
8,jimmy
9,bug is fixed in closing it down per the request by the reporter anuj gupta
10,keyword to description
11,charles thanks for the confirmation we will chat with willem im off today but will work for a couple of days this week sergey
12,thanks for the information that makes sense glad to hear that it helped EMO_POS
13,cant upgrade to mavenassemblyplugin as it breaks the build on macos due to URL
14,belongs to faces EMO_POS
15,for the noise
16,was my mistake
17,just committed this to trunk and branch0.23 thanks arun
18,i thought issue and provided patch were about cocoonservletserviceimpl used by either c2.2 and c3 but only now i see that instead they are related to cocoonservletservicecomponents c2.2 only
19,idea especially if you have a use case for that
20,for fixing it
21,attached
22,think we are very close too
23,EMO_POS ive renamed componentcolorproperty to be componentcolorelement and relationshipaggregation to twistieaggregation
24,to trunk thanks teddy
25,misunderstanding
26,there is no way around this issue of course we must discuss and come to some solution regarding at this point
27,chris i missed it done
28,thanks a lot for the comments
29,imran fixed in luni module at repo revision r568966 please check it was fixed as you expected
30,could not get what keyword means
31,missed that selectbox
32,mike do you know how to get the virtual machine file the link to download from the rcmes web site is broken thanks jinwon kim dept atmospheric and oceanic sciences and joint institute for regional earth system science and engineering university of california los angeles los angeles ca
33,since you didnt respond to my request i finally did without and checked out what you did first of all looking at cincludetransformer i have to say that i dont understand why it is doing its own caching caching should be the concern of pipelines and sources if you want preemptive loading of cached content this would much better be implemented as a source wrapper in fact we now have such a class in the scratchpad area one unpleasant implication of the current design is that as an unsuspecting user of this class when you turn on caching in this transformer the cached contents of any included source that identifies a caching pipeline would be cached twice once by the pipeline itself and once by the cincludetransformer now concerning your patch i dont quite understand why you retain the validity of the cached contents the algorithm the caching pipeline uses to determine the validity of the cached contents is as follows first it looks at the validity of the cached pipeline contents itself then if the validity by itself indicates it needs a current validity to check against then the pipeline contructs a pipeline validity by calling the participating components getvalidity methods if your component now returns the same validity object that you previously returned then that does not make much sense to me since i really needed this functionality myself and i didnt have enough time to discuss and refactor the cincludetransformer i implemented my own very basic includetransformer that does exactly what i need no more no less ill post it here if anyone want to use it i also looked at the xincludetransformer to see if i could implement caching in that one instead but it seems that the xincludetransformer reads included content from url objects instead of from source objects
34,marco i changed the name of patch because it was made in java earliar sorry for inconvenience
35,good to me works for me too EMO_POS
36,are missing my point sorry by check in normally i mean just commit them using svn add svn commit not svn import you cant do that people.apache.org was down for a while but is now back that however is not related as you dont need to access people.apache.org to commit to svn
37,just committed this to trunk thanks note made some slight changes to patch to apply correctly to trunk
38,gav done committed USER_MENTION
39,hard to say i lost nodes in about an hour but i dont know how many i lost last time
40,is a great suggestion
41,is the curent state it is the build.xml it work for tomcat5x it is hard coded the test are passe but i need to remove testsamplefilter.java testfilterhttpheaders.java and testbasicauthentication.java from the test execution i dont know why they failed but continu to look at this nicolas
42,just committed this thanks nicholas
43,looks like a fine approach to me thanks for putting the patch together
44,sorry
45,
46,for the work haohui ive committed it to branch1
47,color isnt really important it was just a suggestion to be more homogeneous but that can be revisited in a different jira i agree an option is a good idea for automatically acknowledging hosts not sure what the default should be the current behavior is obviously to not confirm so we could keep that one or go for a safer one i dont have any strong opinion on that
48,thanks for that i gave it some testing and thought about it over the weekend and it looks perfect thanks aidan
49,doesnt exactly seem fixed to me first of all i cant make this work on an actual released version of the plugin second i cant even get the most recent snapshot to work at all the pom includes all sorts of noise that just shouldnt be required per chriss point can this issue get some attention im fairly certain this plugin just flat out doesnt work in its current state
50,patch is attached to camel606 also address this issue
51,once again for the wrong report stephane
52,was very bad documented
53,i dont have such option or maybe i dont know where it is
54,so a test that succeeds with errors is confusing as hell
55,or any other ruby user id really like to commit that but i need someone of you to review and confirm before so if you want this being part of the next release thank you
56,my bad
57,looks good to me
58,discussion
59,you are right im deeply sorry to bother you guys and im also a bit embarrassed
60,can get average column size from row size column count so we could make it if column size n bytes or sstable is older than gc_grace_period
61,oliver
62,meant the findbugs addon sorry for the confusion
63,bad
64,have attached a patch that provides the necessary translations
65,sounds good new patch uploaded
66,is stuck
67,applied thanks matt
68,it seems that this problem is more on the rubygems side i didnt have time to investigate it any further but looks like rubygems is using USER_MENTION internally sometimes as a hash and sometimes as an array you could try doing the following change in line EMO_NEG USER_MENTION USER_MENTION
69,it
70,thanks hitesh
71,it took so long to drag this up i think the issue i had was with the customer billinginfo and customer shippinginfo relationships billinginfo and shippinginfo each inherit from address iirc a runtime relationship was being created for customer address which was messing things up ill have to dig through the svn history to see what i did with mandatory relationships that i mentioned being problematic in the initial bug submission
72,am currently trying to get it into ajdt dev builds but my git push is timing out damn thing
73,your username was stupidly named and confusing so i deleted it and created a new one more appropriate
74,was looking good for jackrabbit for modeshape there is one more tweak required
75,it seems i forgot a few references to in im attaching a new patch to fix these references
76,biggest problem is that weve had too many committers over the years and wed have to get all of their permission to change it
77,to trunk thanks for review prakash
78,specified directory is not created by agent
79,for the revision i think the release notes look good now i will resolve the issue after a few days to allow for any feedback on knuts suggestion
80,have added deleting to the clean task of my local main build.xml after some more perhaps i will post it as a patch
81,alex it looks like a good path to solve this issue
82,looks good to me
83,really like what i am seeing so far
84,to add the reconciler as part of the keyspace attributes just so i dont forget
85,exactly sorry to be so unclear
86,no longer sleep
87,thanks ning
88,have committed this thanks aaron
89,amp constants refer to instead of and uses the amp constant instead of added additional test case in urlhelpertest
90,just noticed your public tweet bq USER_MENTION true fuck the avro c api
91,uwe
92,why did i not think of that EMO_POS great idea ill move the files to svn
93,amar
94,patch attached
95,commited closing bug
96,revision its just about having an optional ant property for specifying the full path to svnversion ive made the hudson config changes for lucenetrunk add and manually kicked off build if i missed something reopen and ill take a look
97,checked out the patch it looks good to me
98,as we did in hbase770 need to check our hbaserpc to make sure it has any changes from hadoop included when we move to hadoop jars
99,thanks
100,is silly bad package encapsulation
101,updated patches arun let me know it this looks good thanks
102,nick can you please recreate this patch as i cant get the code to compile for starters i cant get the class attributeimplitem to compile please use the latest trunk when doing so thanks george
103,i didnt look at the package thoroughly enough i now see that it can be used in the nonrpc cases also
104,i was going to join in on reporting this problem i had recently downloaded a build from in order to fix a problem i was experiencing with jscookmenu it was not until today that i ran a test in ie and found inputcalendar didnt work i had the same javascript error dateformatsymbols the calendar worked fine in firefox today i downloaded myfaces and can confirm that this problem no longer seems to exist for me cheers kevin
105,developers never do what they should EMO_POS
106,atul that looks good at a first glace
107,to mathias werlitz sorry for the delay
108,just committed this to trunk and branch2.0 thanks xeiguiming
109,about the confusion before
110,that i think i missed some discussion in the mailing list the implementation and test and breakiterator is attached
111,those of us who dont care about ivy in fact lose something a easy to build hbase
112,patch applied
113,to trunk thanks prasad
114,tom
115,i dont think it would be all that different ill take a crack next week after dealing with the next round of hbase6055 stuff
116,a slightly cleaned up version of the patch in revision thanks for your help todd
117,thanks
118,try
119,patch is generated against the latest trunk
120,michael thank you for your answer i thought that it would not be so easy to solve this issue unfortunately i agree with you that the main problem here is that a copy action is missing and i guess attachstrategy.persist is the right place to add some kind of copy functionality i started looking into the source code of the enhanced class from the test persistencecapable declares a public method to copy fields pccopyfields unfortunately you cant use in attachstrategy.persist because the entity to persist has no statemanager at this point an exception invalidstateexception will be the result my suggestion is to modify the class enhancement and remove the statemanager check in pccopyfields i dont see the need for this check afterwards you can use pccopyfields in attachstrategy.persist by adding something like if manager.getcopynew fields new for int i i fields.length i fields this solution works for my testcase as an alternative you can modify or add an additional newinstance to copy the data i have no real experience with openjpa perhaps there is a much better solution
121,in datastorage.linkallblocks you commented our the part you probably wanted to remove it i would avoid all spelling formatting commenting empty line changes because they will make merging hard dont think introducing in is a good idea it is better than what we have now a plain string is a public class we should rather add a public static method to it then finalized will defined only in one place
122,this is quite bad
123,from the job succeeding it doesnt what effect should i be able to measure in order to see if this is doing anything
124,for moving so quickly on this guys
125,dont know what just happened
126,looks like we took to long to get to this the patch no longer applies can you please upmerge to latest
127,appassembler author has rejected a long outstanding bug in this area as wont fix URL they seem to think that because the script is not internally broken that they shouldnt need to worry about it
128,again to claudio tasso
129,this wasnt a problem with my patch right that was an issue of the mahout script in trunk itself yes it was a problem with the script in trunk i believe this was due to the fact that the job files were on the classpath instead of all of the dependency jars adding the job files to the classpath does not add the dependency jars they contain to the classpath as well so no you didnt add this but it should be fixed and is in the patch what is the core option for ive never used it how does it work when youre running in the context of a build the core option is used to tell it to use the build classpath instead of the classpath used for a binary release this just follows the pattern established by doug in the hadoop and nutch launch scripts also added a help message for the run argument near line in EMO_NEG this is different from the help question i had echo seq2sparse generate sparse vectors from a sequence file echo vectordump dump vectors from a sequence file echo run run mahout tasks using the mahoutdriver see URL so you already added the ability to load via classpath right if we merge that way of thinking with what im currently working on having a configurable mahout_conf_dir which is used for all these props files we could just have the mahout shell script just add mahout_conf_dir to the classpath the way you already have it adding the hardwired directory and then it would work that way yep that should do it as long as mahout_conf_dir appears before we should be good to go it should be added outside of the section of the script that determines if core has been specified on the commandline
130,ri sucks why the hell is savestate and restorestate not called with with javax.faces.state_saving_method server
131,applied thanks a lot especially for the test case URL URL the result for and is definitely wrong theres a bug that needs to be fixed eventually but since this is lowpriority for me im going to leave it for now ive added a comment to the new test case blockcontainer4a that explains what is wrong so i think ill close this issue its primarily for the patch after all and the bug wont be missed now that there is a check in our test suite if anyone disagrees just reopen the issue or create a new one
132,to trunk thanks mathias
133,oh hell no
134,glad to be of service EMO_POS
135,to hudson again it didnt run the first time
136,branch2 patch looks good to me ill commit this to branch2 later today to give others a chance to comment

142,taking care of this one doug this looks like a so needs dnoting so in the book as for thanks
143,from holidays so a bit delayed but i confirm andrzejs suggestion a plaintext only summarized is ideal for clustering for example
144,indentation is wrong in the second line
145,sorry
146,quick reference autopagingcontent is the usage in question
147,checked in at revision thanks xu
148,time has flown
149,
150,patch puts all messagedigest creation into util class
151,just committed this thanks arun
152,is working on the ssl session reuse but this buggy bug system does not allow him assign this ticket sigh
153,looks good as for the naming stands for trunk patch imo any branch designations can be add as qualifiers thanks
154,actually i take out the hbase part when i commit
155,this looks good
156,for submission to branch1.2 per
157,
158,as a duplicate of sling394
159,this is one reason why i hate this autoboxing shit since java i would love to have a way to prevent it in code forbidden checks should detect this somehow
160,indicates something amiss
161,
162,added license headers
163,of patch2 to introduce a double class to resolve the final ambiguity for unions
164,this is so stupid
165,back is pretty inefficient in dfs
166,it will break ugly everything seems to work but data is never streamed to cassandra
167,which improvements do you have in mind
168,the patch looks good
169,you harit himanshu
170,screwed up the encoding of the stopwords file sorry
171,have committed the patch to trunk branch2 and branch2.0.4alpha thanks you jagane
172,the hell are you waiting for

175,EMO_POS
176,in rushing to commit i forgot to add author during the commit
177,to trunk thanks for the patch francis do you want to address rams comment about patch thanks for the review andy and ram
178,thanks for fixing the osgi import ill create a new issue for the failing trunk build with more info URL
179,committed this thanks raymie
180,at revision thanks
181,this should be yarn jira filed yarn350 instead
182,with and debug level log output info bsp.yarnbspjob job succeeded
183,ivan long numberofentriestoreplicate lastentryid firstentryid should be lastentryid firstentryid you are right both side entries has to be considered thank a lot for noticing it in general i think this splitting should be in ledgerfragmentreplicator rather than bookkeeperadmin this way you could avoid the need to expose the update of ledger metadata it will make control flow a little more complex as youll have to initiate replication on the next subfragment from the callback of the current but i think it would encapsulate things a bit better yes in general all the split logic should be in lfr i might pushed that code to bkadmin because i dont want to disturb admin key flow much which will go through lfr now anyway i moved that logic still not disturbing bkadmin key flows in anyway attached a patch which addresses the comments also to give more confidence on split fragment scenarios i have added multiple boundary cases for fragmentsplit thanks a lot ivan for your nice reviews
184,handles both meta is not assigned and it is double assigned yes
185,of myfaces2970
186,revision
187,did that hopefully it syncs now cheers kurt
188,link to mail item didnt work
189,my bad let me upload what i have
190,file were missing in the last patch sorry
191,probably a misunderstanding from my side
192,revision thanks shai
193,there is an dependency please go to preferences ldap entry editor and enable the option show operational attributes
194,for the huge delay fabio
195,patch with thanks to chris
196,good thanks
197,sorry varun thanks for the reminder i will have a look at it soon
198,for raising these documentation issues i just committed a fix
199,thanks for the patch rev
200,like the issues are timeout related should be good to go
201,to jar hell
202,did not have time to do it yesterday
203,committed revision
204,my bad
205,dirs created also
206,revision i also plan to backport the fix to the branch
207,bytes comparator would work fine for jaql preferably it would be the same comparators that are already used by the sort code which work on serialized bytes but also on writablecomparables so that might be a problem if these comparators are inconsistent then the sort in will not work properly i think it is ok to document the transitivity requirement but i dont see how you can enforce it in any way different key types are fine as long as the comparator knows how to handle them if you cant reuse the same comparator interface i can always implement my comparisons in another place but i already have two of them one in the writablecomparable and one in the comparator i dont see how column families and the key comparator are related except that they are both tablelevel metadata yes i agree that a single comparator would be used for the entire table
208,looks good
209,
210,make
211,abbreviated the heck out of my arguments and thinking but damn it thats what i think EMO_POS
212,patch with thanks to william
213,the patch for commit to internal branch it has review comments from sreekanth and cos implemented
214,omkar i committed this to branch0.23 as well
215,an attachment xml parsing tool
216,about that
217,sorry i missed that though i did see it on the logs the other being this one fixed in this patch
218,the approach and your patch looks good to me whats the latest on testing eg you verified a v1 install with hsync files correctly upgraded eg leases recovered to v2 or trunk build with this patch nicholas do you have cycles to take a look i spent a while paging in the relevant code and the look good to me but would be good to have another set of eyes the patch itself is straightforward so mostly around subtleties
219,patch reads nice and clean to me didnt try applying though two nits it would be good to have a test of the case where a boolean with the default boost is specified in one bq and a seperate blank bq is specified to force the first bq to be treated as a single query lets assign to a temp variable so we dont have to call it twice in three lines
220,my code base is a little old looks like hadoop9147 add some new test in testfilestatus
221,sorry mark i came back here to remove my comment as after building the app from scratch i have found that by default it used whenexhaustedaction grow and not block
222,for the reviews guys
223,just committed this thanks sanjay
224,lukas for pointing these issues out will review your fixes and do the necessary changes the jms transport fix should go to axis2 transports project
225,looks good to me
226,looks good to me
227,is where it gets confusing
228,step do you think the doublesplitting is a new phenomenon it doesnt sound like something that should happen very often maybe that would explain why i didnt get this error in also please note i went straight from to so i dont know if it was present in
229,thanks roman
230,looks good will check this in once jenkins gives its blessings
231,sagara thank you very much for looking into this
232,you guys
233,wei ive committed your latest patch to svn
234,they do then suses cpio works for old ascii but the c switch is broken
235,scott git formatted patches are fine in my opinion lets get this fixed
236,a patch that adds javadoc in the filesystem class
237,to trunk thanks andrey
238,some more stuff and realized i was doing it wrong
239,for misleading attachment name
240,forgot to mention it in issue description i use commonsnet2.0.jar i.e version its because scott bjerstedt wrote in vfs264 that for his patch to work we need to use commonsnet
241,sanjay
242,thanks sharan
243,and i think im sufficiently convinced that its ok for as well i think tjake was planning to commit this so ill leave it here for the time being until he has a chance to look it over thanks stephen
244,hairong the speedups you measured with this patch are very impressive it would be great to have it included in the system the patch still applied successfully to current trunk when i tried it so can you please go ahead and submit patch so we see how it does with testpatch and ill review it and try to get someone else to also thanks
245,ashish for committing the patch
246,revision committed revision
247,my bad
248,since is now released
249,will try to do more research on it
250,
251,EMO_POS
252,again
253,you clean everything out
254,i disagree with a signficant amount of statements you made i dont think we would ever come to agreement anyway
255,in svn revision thanks dims
256,ill add these
257,i wanted to do that long time but some tests were made me afraid
258,think the correct resolution is to ensure that the prefix stack mechanism gets reset each time the xmlreader is used
259,very good
260,think its a good idea to go ahead and put a patch together so we can discuss it directly
261,thanks dont forget to add line to changes.txt when committing
262,dan
263,sian patch applied in security modulke and third party notices file at repo revision r543463 please check it was applied as you expected
264,sucks
265,committed this thanks miki
266,pm brian minchau wrote hi helge im afraid you cant assign someone to review however i will have a look at your patch any progress in reviewing my patch helge schulz URL
267,committed rev thanks mike
268,test passed submit to hudson
269,by ted today
270,sorry the codeline
271,bad
272,you ashish vijaywargiya and pranay pandey EMO_POS thanks and regards akash jain
273,too am concerned about the drda byte character string limit
274,thanks namit
275,in trunk there were two places where the ack message was getting the destination from the message assigned to it instead of the destination from the messagedispatch command
276,the samples you gave are different
277,sorry for the late attaching latest version patch
278,this patch looks good lets remove from and work on a better implementation on
279,ok the latest patch all tests pass for me great awesome EMO_POS
280,lindberg absolutely you are right i was not farsighted enough to think of that thank you about your my one is not a good idea i will try to fix it t.t thanks again
281,guess somethings getting confused about reversedness
282,maven
283,thanks
284,thanks gang tim liu
285,reported this crash to oracle in plenty of time and the wrongresults bug has been open since may URL but oracle decided not to fix that too
286,dont think there is any sense in this who cares we reported this crash to oracle in plenty of time and the wrongresults bug has been open since may URL but oracle decided not to fix that too
287,a new patch that compiles without errors against jdk1.4.2 it also accounts for the customizable port part derby4217 which the previous patch didnt
288,can we just make it final when we backport this change duh no we cant since we have core ir impls subclassing ir
289,good minor nit can you change back to info.wait otherwise
290,just committed this thanks boris
291,eduardo i have tried with your settings for the timezone i was not able to reproduce it the meeting was correctly displayed in the calendar the meeting times in the ical invitations where send fine i tried also with simple email the invitation hash also worked fine and had the correct time validity
292,for the patch committed to
293,is not needed in trunk trunk will be taken care of in hadoop7853
294,this patch looks reasonable to me thanks hairong
295,you jing for the review
296,a patch that adds a flag for optin and adds a test
297,jon patch looks good minor nitpick i have is that it would be nice to give the test a more relevant name than testautomaticallymadename something like testrelationaliasforbincond but i am not going to insist
298,sorry for late reply i upload the patch to URL could you help to review it thx
299,lars sorry about the delay in responding good point about the treemap always returning result in a deterministic ordering the patch itself i think is still beneficial because it removes a little bit of redundancy in the existing equality code imo the fix makes it easier to understand as well in addition the tests are beneficial since we were missing coverage there i think itd be better if the fix were in sooner but its probably not an issue if we moved it to
300,you also remove from line
301,
302,damn intellij its not like patch format hasnt been standard for years
303,patch went to the wrong bug
304,revision
305,we didnt enforce an exec for sh but we did for fs
306,patch generated from cxf
307,sounds like some serious buck passing
308,in trunk thanks henri
309,youre pretty well screwed
310,for the reviews
311,asf is going to get the document signed this week will keep you posted
312,i missed this since it wasnt tagged ios looking at it now
313,recommendation in the wiki is bad

315,thanks
316,i didnt use your patch but i think youll like the end result
317,andi
318,oliver
319,in revision paulex please verify it resolves the issue
320,for that
321,dont vote they whine that something or everything sucks
322,apologies i submitted the wrong patch file ive checked the trunk and what you applied is correct so i wont re submit thanks for covering my sloppiness
323,life myfacess
324,looks good to me
325,idea those are lost to the ages but ill try to reproduce
326,of the changes made in this patch
327,was taken care of already
328,sucks
329,to have not spotted this one and thanks for your care
330,with a network that tolerates almost everything to get a mail somehow in the right place it is only seldom noticed or when it is it is blamed on microsoft
331,committed a patch to trunk to make access to bundle state volatile please close this issue if you are satisfied
332,on holiday last week and just catching up
333,to trunk thanks jeff
334,we should have a filesystemspecific method that indicates whether a path is fullyqualified
335,tiago thanks for looking at this issue on visual inspection of the change your text change looks fine however i cant apply the patch you need to svn diff from the top of the tree show it shows the path staring with you should reopen the issue until it has been committed also just for good measure you should run suites.all and derbyall in case there are any canon updates needed thanks kathey
336,this case data would pretty much just silently be lost
337,to branch and trunk thanks for review stack
338,great stuff maria thanks
339,USER_MENTION tks for your review and commtents my reply as follows bq.have you tried it does it works for you yes ive tested it in our env and works well is this required executor null my intention was to set
340,i think the comments here are a bad sign i sent us down an unfortunate slippery slope we are a search engine library dont put shit in the index directory or we will delete your shit dead simple
341,thanks jarek
342,this as wont fix
343,i have no sql server to test against at the moment but i wonder does this work when using a table name like sometable note the upper case if you could verify for me that such mixed case names work with your patch when not in delimited mode then ill apply it asap tom
344,of sling1529
345,more reference overhead in the hregion update the patch
346,fix causes test to fail in other circumstances apparently file.delete cant be relied upon to actually delete the file
347,i missed bills comment bq weve seen similar exceptions when loading data that contains text with the column delimiter in it which produces shorter than expected tuples could that be the case here i dont think thats the case here however ive made many silly in pig before let me double check
348,sravya
349,just committed this i changed it so that mapper and reducer extend a closeable interface rather than both providing a close method directly
350,fouseragent.getstream is cool and very easy to use now that its properly documented
351,sounds good to me
352,for volunteering for this prashanth
353,dushshantha please find the attached file axis2c1193manual.patch
354,after blooper i hate svn
355,ive committed your patch leaving out the change to equals and not removing mergebooleanqueries as that is a public method which someone might be using also could you please check if the test case is correct now i couldnt apply that part of your patch cleanly and something might have been broken
356,looks simple and sweet to me
357,reply to comment in reply to comment created an attachment main patch file iv had problems again applying the patch something went wrong with fontsetup looks like the patch wants to remove this file entirely which i dont think should be the case hmm not sure quite why that happened also why did you change the default_strict_fo_validation constant into default_strict_validation i think it would be clearer to leave it as is have done
358,wholeheartedly agree this api is confusing as hell
359,i committed this thanks jothi
360,for the suggestion raghu let me try it
361,sorry i cant be more obliging
362,pretty
363,seems some of the wrappers in ink_hrtime.h might no longer be used either e.g ink_gettimeofday is never used so lets get rid of that shit
364,i meant to have this patch in sooner but got quite busy i expect to have it soon
365,is awesome stefan thanks a million
366,applied ok
367,is a test case to reproduce it i launch it on a jdk1.6 and it deadlocks each to run
368,kihwal
369,more comment this should be in the incompatible section in changes.txt
370,in these days where everyone that can put a cd the right way up in a drive is a expert this has become pretty common
371,catch thanks for the thorough explanation and suggestions i think it all makes sense will work on a patch
372,revision
373,i can give you one advice on this one id say this fuck derby use h2 instead as the default embedded database
374,jurgen yes thats probably a good idea but not something that can be easily quickly implemented id like to change this jira to from a bug to an improvement so that it can be looked at in a future release thanks for the suggestion
375,the patch which addresses the issue in entrylogger
376,thiru i hope you havent already started working on this
377,im not sure i understand are you saying that b would violate this or just that the status quo does im saying b would violate this yes b was bootstrap from the right token but if that one isnt up bootstrap from any other token preferring the closer ones right im saying we cant just automatically choose another token if the user didnt specifically say its ok
378,the bit to sign the sourcerelease is being called when the sourcerelease isnt being built because the sourcerelease is only built at the executionroot
379,have checked in this change which can be reviewed here URL would appreciate any feedback i just have the feeling this entire controlregistry is growing over our heads taking a look at many older applications with older click releases i cant stop thinking that click was very good for years without it i also received a few custom components for maintenance and i dont think this change nor controlregistry is of any needed in them or maybe simply im not getting the entire concept of course im a newbie but my impression is that most of the advantages you list are for clickclick is it possible that the problem is with the clickclick that should be changed not with click many parts of click are simple to understand and nice but this one is not making it even more complex is just a guarantee that users like me will understand it even less from what i saw one of the most important parts of click is backward compatibility for this however click should remain very simple otherwise it will get big and it cant afford published experiments tapestry on the other and can do this since with every new version they throw aboard the entire compatibility so experiments if go wrong are not that a problem and history shows that complex things always go wrong sooner or later latest one with t5.2 theyll trow maven away now EMO_POS my wish is when i look at the click source code to be able to quickly understand whats up there cause only so i have a good feeling when i use it in applications otherwise i have that black box feeling and its not fun i think like this are most users those who prefer complex thing have a very huge choice of concurrent frameworks EMO_POS
380,the patch looks good
381,feature lars
382,patch looks good to me pending jenkins
383,
384,boy hell broke loose EMO_POS so the biggest issue im facing is indeed with random sharing across threads
385,requires java
386,is no close in filecontext users are not supposed to close filecontext
387,remember how to put the state of this issue to in progress not a big deal anyway
388,i am against fetch groups in principle
389,only one of us should play lawyer and the other one play engineer
390,i would close this out from the fix to jbseam3742 except the quartz and seampay examples use a custom xml namespace and the xml schema validator is not happy with that
391,seems to be stuck on this
392,bad
393,to trunk with revision
394,thank you for working on it do you have plan when you submit a patch i know it takes efforts to code and test in different types of databases would you please release mysql version first then file a jira to follow up just a suggestion for fast release but up to you to decide thanks a lot again tim
395,rustam finally i will not commit the imap351 patch so it will be good that you attach your patch here thx eric
396,the hell
397,if this spams things however its unlikely that ill work on these
398,all resolved tickets from or older
399,looks good
400,a patch fix npe in debug message
401,believe this issue is resolved by the patch in flume648
402,for you work on this jayachandra
403,a good point we should make sure that it doesnt decrease performance for one of the database types even if it increases it for oracle in which case making it configurable in ooziesite.xml would be a good idea too
404,just committed this thanks edwin
405,didnt know about a trinidad regex validator ive created it from scratch didnt look for any validator code on the internet because i wanted to make sure it was jsf compliant
406,redeploy patch
407,thanks
408,in clickide
409,if we all nag joe walnes enough we might be able to persuade him to release a new qdox which can ignore annotations etc though it will still struggle with generics i think
410,fix this post wss4j1.5.3
411,to branch and trunk thanks for the patch ramkrishna
412,of hdfs2321
413,alan i was merely commenting on the title of the jira not the udf name
414,at r504842 thanks
415,there any plans to also publish the new release to the maven repository on ibiblio.org we at jackrabbit still use maven as our build tool
416,name gets confusing with all of our prenamed and classes
417,new to spring integration so forgive me for the stupid things i might say
418,pieter it looks fine now thanks your mirror will be added to the list in an hour or so groeten henk penning
419,have committed the patch for trunk thanks tanping
420,for this my bad
421,for taking care of this alejandro
422,to trunk thanks prasanth
423,like this broke imports into intellij
424,alena hope all is well sorry for delayed response the vms dont belong to any project i could not find a way to retrieve all vms without looping the projects thanks ilya
425,eclipse ui was completly stuck which was similiar to the other experinces
426,here the patch for the groovy script cool looks good thanks
427,about that

429,not entering bogus reports for the hell of it EMO_POS matt
430,awesome thanks dims
431,the patch looks good
432,thanks namit
433,rishi solanki to review the patch
434,this has been done it should work just fine ill be doing some more work on jira later and will force a reindex then so this might look better after that have a look around
435,forward to your patch
436,you do need an instance of qcm to get the listener but you dont need the listener because youre using le im uploading a patch in which i have commented out some lines of the new test you wrote this is how i think it should look like if you agree please remove those lines and submit a new patch note that i have also changed the leader election parameter in the new instance of quorumpeer in mockserver to
437,status from assigned to new for consistency
438,attachement with asf grant this time forgot to check the first time sorry
439,sorry for the delay it looks like this patch slipped through i tried to apply it but there are a bunch of conflicts some of them are related to recent docstring format changes and other seem to be related to other changes can you please regenerate the patch against the latest trunk thanks
440,it is stuck somewhere
441,kher to benjamin camille am minutes ago hi ben i was going to open a jira after checking with you guys with your solution wont we run in into the problem that camille pointed out by marking the snapshot for lastzxid peer fails after taking the snapshot the snapshot has applied lastzxid which created a child znode during recovery it will apply lastzxid which will faill with nodeexists and we will increment the cversion of the parent after fix for zookeeper1046 so creation of sequential znodes wont be be really sequential this is probably acceptable but should be clearly documented if not then from this bug it looks to me that patch zookeeper1046 was also not complete we may need to conditionally update cversion i think we need a clear document of how snapshots are supposed to work and what to assume while taking snapshots and while recovering from snapshots it will be very helpful for to verify the correctness of implementation and for future bug fixes.i will open a jira for this bug shortly and post our discussion as well thanks vishal
442,thanks for your commit it fix this problem and my example works fine now with this fix
443,richard patch was applied to luni module at repo revision please check that the patch was applied as you expected ive got strange commit notification with message lines stripped
444,the launch console message
445,to branch thanks remus
446,yes i believe this has been resolved
447,is awesome
448,this record since is now released
449,john for bringing this up and also for providing the patch
450,could have been created as a patch and that is far as its gotten assuming that were talking were just talking about creating a simple snk to create strongly named assemblies when talking about signing assembly i didnt see a snk file in the lucene.net_2_9_4g branch when setting up the build scripts i havent looked in trunk yet the lucene.net_4e branch should have a already have a snk i could add the same snk file to trunk and the branch when i go add the build scripts to the trunk this weekend so that all the branches are building strong assemblies someone would still need to go back to the tag and create a version using the snk whenever the next release does come out
451,this is deemed to be a valid bug you can use my upcoming patch which simply doesnt pass the calls to getlogintimeout and setlogintimeout through to the basicdatasource i guess it could be a good thing to let the basicdatasource throw the unsupportedoperationexception notifying the programmer that their call to the method really isnt doing anything otoh they probably care more about successfully migrating their app to and this is just getting in the way if they really want to know why their call to setlogintimeout isnt working they can check the included javadoc so if you decide its a bug then theres a patch coming
452,am an idiot this was a dupe of guvnor84
453,did not want to add a framework but rather the opposite
454,see you rebased the patch thanks a lot
455,patch looks good thanks a lot
456,fix for to unknown on issues not targeted for
457,feature with wrong functionality is as bad as if not worse than a bad performance
458,i tought i could commit this patch but i did not realize that one of the files is in the framework and i have not access to it
459,thats right
460,commited
461,roman which version of servicemix are you using there is an camel feature which includes camelcore camelspring and camelosgi in the org.apache.felix.karaf.features.cfg you need to replace it with camelcore and camelspringosgi please make sure there is no camelspring camelspringosgi camelosgi installed at the same time
462,working thanks
463,for the spam but which test method cant find any related to the snappuller on trunk
464,just committed this to trunk thanks owen
465,bad is it
466,adriano can you summarize all your changes in both issues into a changes.txt entry for both branches hi uwe yes i can do it i will need to review the entire code again and trunk i plan to do this during the weekend but if you want commit viniciuss code and i commit the changes to changes.txt later EMO_POS
467,for the help bj
468,must have clicked the wrong link i didnt mean to mark this resolved
469,it works fine
470,updated documentation of the processor is now at URL USER_MENTION what params were on your mind as candidates for keyword instead of and for what potential future reasons
471,
472,of juddi310
473,just committed this thanks pat
474,speedup finally all this work shows great results
475,just committed this thanks pat
476,the latest version of the patch from review incorporates a trivial javadoc fix as suggested
477,should have commented on this much sooner
478,patch looks good and so do the tests thanks my only question is why were the following lines added to setup the test seems to pass just fine without them and i did not understand their need
479,if it is just a documentation bug even better thanks for the clarification
480,i get a chance i may even roll it into our dev environment but i am currently in the middle of mem leak hell
481,new files sorry
482,tests on this will commit once it is done sorry this one fell off my radar
483,is no mxmlc.exe in the release only mxml for osx and linux and mxml.bat for windows how did you install
484,attached
485,about that
486,thanks for pointing out this it is now fixed in rev
487,to trunk thanks sushanth
488,is not yet tested i ran into strange build problems with apr
489,dont think that any special filtering should be performed for the access control content such as e.g nodes but as far as i can see you didnt incorporate this into the patch right testing for tree exists in the nodedelegate looks ok to me
490,its nice to see another application on top of yarn since its a lot of new code could you please add some notes on the high level components and suggest some pointers on navigating the code it will help review the changes thanks
491,dyslexia
492,as r1406707 thanks for reviewing sijie
493,caller may not notice what happend right now
494,for looking into this allan
495,
496,with the readahead removal
497,an attachment javadoc patch to org.apache.xalan.lib and org.apache.xalan.lib.sql
498,problems with continuous replication timeouts introduced by r916518 and r916868
499,a stupid name i chose for that object EMO_NEG
500,db name is tpcdb user name tpc pwd whatever
501,aidan can you take care of this when you do qpid1010 thanks
502,to branch thanks eli
503,to trunk thanks ning
504,bilgin it is working fine now
505,fixes my testcase thank you
506,change was only applied to the branch it needs to be merged to trunk
507,cassandra244 got in the way im not sure what the right solution is here i buy the premise of that you dont necessarily want to get hammered by compaction when youre first starting up warming up caches so i dont think check for compactions ever n seconds is a great policy but im not sure check every n seconds starting m minutes after startup is great either because its not something a user will just guess when hes wondering why arent compactions happening yet any other ideas
508,objects were not serializable
509,thanks tom
510,the following to getrollbackonly EMO_NEG if status status.status_no_transaction throw new is no transaction in progess
511,dhruba
512,it back in if you think different
513,revision
514,updated the revision hive2797 make the ip address of a thrift client available to hmshandler reviewers jira njain ashutoshc ran updated my checkout revision detail URL affected files
515,fix is attached
516,like patch failed qa due to lack of tests are there existing tests for the shell at a glance i couldnt find any
517,thanks for the heads up ben
518,still need a lot of work but theres an initial version checked into the sandbox now URL see status.txt for design notes and such
519,is quite bad
520,thank you for your work ill test it today and let you know what i find
521,committed this thanks nicholas
522,you very much richard
523,missed the context
524,jacques i have not seen that it was a grouped bugs in this case i have used to set in the grouped bugs the sum of the components used by detailed issues i didnt like unknow components otherwise we can add a new fictitious component grouped issues and assign this component to this type of issue thanks marco
525,tucu you are right i had not thought of that im on the fence because we are serializing a process which should happen fast so parallelizing is good like you already mentioned bq add a method in the filesystem to disable its shutdown hook mrappmaster would disable it and call closeall explicitly it already does this is already present by setting false so im not sure what problem this jira is fixing or are we planning for the future im fine with the latter answer being yes im just curious the patch looks good for what it intends to do although the latest one doesnt include the fixes you made in response to nicholas comments
526,also rename the references in droidsspring commited revisions r985451 r985452
527,may suck but at least wont be the one bringing in a dumb dependency to a logging library
528,revision
529,that should have said fixed via hadoop4980 not
530,bad
531,bad contenttype from gsoap
532,patch looks good

536,everyone
537,fknames patch looks good

540,
541,to trunk thanks tim
542,apologies for the confusion
543,applied thanks
544,to operability and to trunk thanks for the patch jie
545,do you expect problems when we upgrade camel to spring and deploy it into karaf because camel leverage on the karaf spring feature it will use spring when running inside karaf and spring when running in karaf imo when we can upgrade to spring without any modification it should not a problem
546,created a regression test for harmony1654 and attached it to harmony3522
547,ilya
548,for the patch applied to and
549,just committed this thanks milind
550,for the patch applied for
551,ive started working on this i think i have an idea of what to do designwise but if anyone has any suggestions please let me know
552,think we all know it just sucks
553,was my bad
554,ram that seems like a definite improvement
555,mean keep purging that cache asset
556,for the patch daryn i put it into trunk branch2 and branch0.23
557,i just committed this to trunk and branch0.23 thanks derek also branch2
558,USER_MENTION in trunk thanks lufeng if and when you get around to the patch for i can review the patches for tests are very welcome in nutch thank you
559,to at revision
560,this is solrs fault by having a getter that does some heavy duty xml shit
561,all resolved tickets from or older
562,bruno and bilgin you patches are in trunk revision great to see good cooperation at work EMO_POS
563,this is done thanks
564,bad forgot to include the test file in the patch resubmitting in a second
565,believe in relativity EMO_POS
566,sorry i didnt see you comment until id committed the change sian tested it for me ive no idea what the msvcr71.dll issue is but i dont think that is anything to do with my changes the issue for icu3.4.zip should be fixed with my patch
567,looks good
568,for me thank you paulex
569,it thanks for the explanation
570,of hadoop3906 plz comment there
571,encoding for nonarray request parameters it doesnt look like i can remove previously attached files whoever is reviewing the code should use the latest patch
572,to midnight utc after parsing sounds fine to me yymmdd looks good too
573,good
574,sorry it took me so long to get back to this
575,andreas sorry for my late reply i havent looked in to the difference between using the responsebuilder getfilters and using filters in a normal query are there any functional differences between the two ways other than that one of them utilizes solrs filtercache and the other doesnt
576,is interesting here is that the oom error already occurs while processing the soap part of the message and not while accessing the attachment part as one would expect what is the stack trace that you get with axis2 and axiom
577,please pull request away my friend
578,to fix this i am planning to remember completed containers only id at node manager for predefined time does that time sounds reasonable or we should make it configurable i dont really think adding a new configuration parameter will be a good idea but i am open for any different approach adding conf thoughts this will have a similar implementation like yarn62 but only difference is that yarn62 only tracks container for a time after it starts to avoid duplicate launch where as this tries to avoid logging errors for valid stop attempts
579,you post saxon error message
580,looks good
581,EMO_POS you got there before me
582,for review and test case knut
583,make
584,thanks for taking a look sure i will make that change on commit
585,things going on with google chrome uploading patch files corrupts the file with msie it worked sorry for the noise yesterday it worked normally
586,another refresh
587,bad move
588,otis
589,patch
590,for the confusion EMO_POS
591,
592,for the patch janko i put the changes into and
593,issue arises due to the call to in the docs target of it uses the system if it can find it so the solution might be to add a note to ant to describe the abovementioned workarounds is there a better way to call forrest targets from within project ant build files see for145 make forrest able to be imported by ant
594,apply this patch file cheers kaushalye
595,am perfectly fine with that it seems like more overhead but i am fine either way
596,for the new patch kim
597,sucks to lose the code readability but it seems like a reasonable price to pay
598,just committed this thanks for the reviews doug btw the last patch didnt include the removal of so i did that manually when i committed
599,for getting started on this i have a couple of requests could you please upload a patch to this jira and grant it to apache this patch doesnt apply cleanly to trunk would you mind updating a patch that would it will make it much easier for us to review it also when you said the zk connect option hangs did you get a chance to take a look at the logs to see where it hangs do you mind uploading those log files here
600,catch sorry about that i had run the tests but i guess i didnt rerun on the very latest rev against latest trunk new patch fixes the npes
601,you please share how is it impacting
602,to branch and trunk thanks gab
603,to in rev along with geronimo3840
604,just committed this thanks jitendra
605,you see my patch EMO_POS thank you
606,avdhesh i forgot to add these two files to the patch here is the new patch containing the missing files
607,do it now thanks
608,ie
609,all this just doesnt make sense from a pure performance aspect
610,add in the jar then tim that dslkit is gpl so i cant check it in looks good though
611,of xercesc1810
612,also happens at the very startup after he has loaded only sstables hence datatracker likely have sstables not a shit load
613,branch resolving thanks for the patch gary
614,word on whether it will be fixed
615,took me a while to figure out where the problem is coming from sorry so your way is not a bad way of doing it though let me suggest an alternative in abstractfileobject match the constructors by putting a in abstracts dodetach this way the count will be corrected currently its appears to be wrong in many implementations in the overriding implementation of detach do a check of if fs.isreleasable fs.close patches included
616,looks good to me also bq core tests testspecialcharactersinoutputpath failed with noclassdeffounderror i ran the same test on my machine with the patch it ran successfully
617,to allow removing the token and throw ue instead of an internal error when trying to insert and the number of endpoints is less than the rf
618,thanks for adding nice debug logging too EMO_POS
619,i must have missed this email i am sorry i will get this done and the other changes to support the updatingmultiplelinearregression class i updated my source and noticed the changes were missing i did my detective work and noticed this mea culpa greg
620,i missed some of this the first time
621,name
622,what i can see on the system the libpthread is in and in and both of those paths are in my library config
623,i thought submit patch was the way to attach a patch
624,bad
625,sandy committed to trunk and branch2
626,patch applied at revision r428265 thanks a lot for this enhancement please verify that the problem is fully fixed as you expected
627,thanks harsh the patch looks good also might it be reasonable to mark just isinsafemode USER_MENTION since this is a new api we are not sure if want to change it lets leave it asis for the moment
628,dianne
629,benjamin did you actually take a look at the attached manifest.mf are the import and export statements in there correct what is in the xml above is just the instructions to create the exact list by introspection EMO_POS if you think it would be better to explicitly list everything when creating the manifest please state what you would like to see in there
630,an attachment proposed addition to javadocs
631,unassigning myself from this backport
632,
633,author bikas saha date mon may tez123 cleanup package dependencies bikas
634,holly thanks i have the one comment where is the code for internalrecursivebundletracker i dont see it in the patch did i miss the source code for it lin
635,have this issue where my server and client is creating a lot of loopback threads that i believe must be related to this issue
636,did it wrong this time
637,for the delay
638,last enhancements thanks guys
639,have fixed this in the twitter fork you can review the fix at URL if you are fine with the change i will submit this as a patch
640,testfileconcurrentreader failure seems to be happening on a lot of builds its caused by the process running out of file handles maybe ulimit needs to be changed on the hudson server
641,feature performance it looks like scripts are read from the resource loader and parsed again eval for every update request
642,thanks kevin
643,committed to trunk thanks hari
644,to trunk and thanks simon
645,for the update tom this is getting close some more comments public stable it is public not sure about whether it is stable yet id tend to lean towards making it stable to ensure its never broken it probably deserves that status given how central it is to the framework thoughts i dont see either audience for this yet it the patch maybe you missed it bq are markableiterator and markableiteratorinterface public user classes the unit test for them testvalueiterreset implies that the user instantiates a markableiterator public bq i left all of the lib.db classes public evolving since they are used by various extensions and users does this sound reasonable public yes public yes public yes again i dont see audience as public another human miss on your part or am i seeing the wrong patch comments on rest of the classes i missed in the first pass unstable unstable public used in cluster unstable public job.gettaskcompletionevent limitedprivate for schedulers limitedprivate for schedulers public maybe evolving since endusers use this directly limitedprivate mr pig odd i thought this was public but i cant find any uses for it the fairscheduler uses it so limitedprivate public accessible via jobclient
646,note looks good
647,we have USER_MENTION annotion the generated wsdl contains duplicate schemas see test jaxwsservicebuildertest.testdoclit
648,there any plans to release a if yes can this fix be included
649,should have been getdatamodel not getdatatable
650,applied thanks
651,the cos and balaji comments latest patch for yahoo security branch
652,diffs look good to me but it sounds like this only solves part of hte problems so we should probably file another bug to get the mgmt gui functional for maybe
653,daniel thanks in advance for your support
654,just put fix in under this issue
655,validation is working fine for me with ff but the submit action for lesson1 is still not working ie still throws some really disturbing error messages which i could not yet resolve
656,in sca java rc4
657,the fix is good please close this jira thanks a lot
658,not too bad once cacheconfig is in
659,doug for the change
660,i was wrong about needing to fix gump that just needs the build.xml patch to remove the copy of the files in lib
661,everyone whats the status of this issue have you found and workarounds
662,the patch with revision
663,commited in cvs
664,works for me lg committing thanks
665,to trunk thanks for review stack and ryan
666,looks good
667,is bad
668,right skipping the clear would be buggy again EMO_POS
669,happy to use it as the standard logo i.e website etc
670,patch applied at r52665 thanks a lot for this enhancement please verify thanks
671,cant reproduce this error i also cant properly navigate in your example since the ui doesnt properly work on a nexus tried on the nexus but your splash screen took too long
672,
673,patch into trunk and cxf2.2.x branch with thanks to william
674,
675,if the user uploaded a file in the first fileuploadfield then it should be handled by the first nested form and if he uploaded a file in the second then it should be handled by the second and if both then both if only outer form process all the submit then i understand that it can be difficult to implement what i expect are nested form informed of the submition or not in fact fileuploadexception is raised only for size limit exceeded cant we handle this thru an iformvalidator instead of a hardcoded check
676,patch looks good
677,i think if were going to do a sweep up of shit we should just kill root
678,an idiot
679,revision r580334 regression test added
680,is your friend
681,quickstart for the bug as project sorry for the delay
682,you ment this content it still doesnt post the form values in ie but works fine in ff thanks a lot for your quick response i really really appreciate ravi ravi mangalagiri URL my personal website coming soon c
683,might be a bug indeed
684,opened to fix a wrong url but appart from that i dont theres still references to the old structure
685,this is hdfs4866 releated ive added reference
686,ivan for take a look ill go through and work on this weekend
687,ivan ill do the changes by just return if it matches as you suggested ill investigate it later bq.auditor will be a top level daemon so it should own its create its own ledgermanagers and zookeeper client the only thing passed in to is should be the configuration anyway we are planning to have initialization class which does starting auditor and rw threads would you agree to create ledgermanagers there and pass it to the auditor and rw daemons in that case shall i keep the ctor as it is by taking managers public bookieidentifier abstractconfiguration conf zookeeper zkc ledgermanager ledgermanager ledgerunderreplicationmanager ledgerunderreplicationmanager
688,cant cache kv can we have something for one server first
689,james this patch has been applied by chirino in the revision at sep
690,bad
691,thanks yongqiang
692,thanks for the headsup bikas this jira is not concerned with the tez integration for pig and is simply the abstraction in pig to allow for alternate executionengines in pig but will certainly change this on the tez integration side of stuff thanks a lot for continuing this i think everything looks good from my end i can certainly see why we may want to keep this on a different branch until everything is finalized certain things may still need more work for example outputstats is not completed abstracted out as it still has references to postore which is a mr implementation construct may still need more abstraction especially ppnl and reworking to incorporate a new executionengine abstraction i think what we have done here is the minimum foundation for an abstraction though and it would be appropriate to put into trunk but these are not my decisions to make with regard to public methods that were changed i dont think most of them are a big deal besides as cheolsoo said the pigserver throwing pigexception i never thought ioexception was a good exception to throw but i think reverting pigserver back to ioexception as it is userfacing code is not a big deal the rest of the method signature changes shouldnt be worrisome because most of them are internal to the project however the change from jobstats to mrjobstats while necessary as each executionengine would have its own type of jobstats it would present to the end user could be problematic because it is userfacing code and would probably break people who were previously using jobstats that i think is the most important thing to keep in mind the task of making the ppnl and jobstats clearly tied to the executionengine should be thought through also
693,patch
694,sure if the patch was pushed for review or not in any case fixing the build is pretty trivial the changes made to modificationstatement should just be reverted and we should just pass the cl in argument to executewithcondition to sp.cas other than that i believe we now refuse cl.serial for the cas method because cl.blockfor throw an unsupportedoperationexception for serial maybe we can make serial mean wait for nothing on commit not even a local one which probably amount to making cl.blockfor return for serial and adding a if in writeresponsehandler ctor to signal right away if blockfor is i dont think cl.any will really work as for normal writes since we dont generate hints for commit maybe we could generate hints ultimately btw but in the meantime it might make more sense to refuse it and thus make the default for cas be either serial if we do the preceding point or one we dont call cl.validateforwrite when calling cas and we shouldnt as it complains with serial but maybe we should add a validateforconditionalwrite that would at least check we have the right replication strategy when using the multidc specific cls
695,think you should get rid of the openended version spec as it occasionally screws things up by bringing in snapshots or nonworking code otherwise to my eyes it looks good
696,you babak
697,of cassandra4587
698,is not what i build a framework for
699,tests i did with a modified pe i ran the pe with a number from to and incremented by the garbage collector was called after each run here are the results info hbase.manyperformanceevaluation info hbase.manyperformanceevaluation info hbase.manyperformanceevaluation info hbase.manyperformanceevaluation info hbase.manyperformanceevaluation info hbase.manyperformanceevaluation info hbase.manyperformanceevaluation info hbase.manyperformanceevaluation info hbase.manyperformanceevaluation info hbase.manyperformanceevaluation info hbase.manyperformanceevaluation info hbase.manyperformanceevaluation info hbase.manyperformanceevaluation info hbase.manyperformanceevaluation info hbase.manyperformanceevaluation info hbase.manyperformanceevaluation info hbase.manyperformanceevaluation info hbase.manyperformanceevaluation info hbase.manyperformanceevaluation info hbase.manyperformanceevaluation info hbase.manyperformanceevaluation info hbase.manyperformanceevaluation info hbase.manyperformanceevaluation info hbase.manyperformanceevaluation info hbase.manyperformanceevaluation info hbase.manyperformanceevaluation info hbase.manyperformanceevaluation info hbase.manyperformanceevaluation info hbase.manyperformanceevaluation info hbase.manyperformanceevaluation info hbase.manyperformanceevaluation info hbase.manyperformanceevaluation info hbase.manyperformanceevaluation info hbase.manyperformanceevaluation info hbase.manyperformanceevaluation info hbase.manyperformanceevaluation info hbase.manyperformanceevaluation info hbase.manyperformanceevaluation info hbase.manyperformanceevaluation info hbase.manyperformanceevaluation info hbase.manyperformanceevaluation info hbase.manyperformanceevaluation info hbase.manyperformanceevaluation info hbase.manyperformanceevaluation info hbase.manyperformanceevaluation info hbase.manyperformanceevaluation info hbase.manyperformanceevaluation info hbase.manyperformanceevaluation it seems that was an overkill the gain is impressive between and then around we pretty much reduced the rpc call at its smallest value
700,thought of porting this patch to i just ran derbyall on the branch and this came up
701,mind chiming in on the rationale of the setquota vs setspacequota naming ie the former for namespace agree w nicholas that we should move setquota from dfs to this admin class lets do that in a follow on change theres an extra in the setq
702,v6 integrated to trunk thanks for the patch jeanmarc thanks for the review matteo USER_MENTION do you want this in as well
703,proposed solution i outlined above on github URL but i cant find a way to use this in combination with artifactnamespace so it will have to be one or the other
704,just committed this to the hdfs347 branch thanks a lot for the contribution colin
705,
706,should do null in the atompub case its actually going to be optimized if the entry is already an appobjectentry and no futher remote repository access will be done
707,perfect thank you
708,sorry about this
709,could you just create a patch file that i can apply
710,for reminding me i agree ill do it
711,this is not completely solved
712,for the mistake
713,patch looks pretty good to me one question for you though does loosening this check for the qjm case not unnecessarily weaken the check in the nonqjm case
714,dawid
715,bilgin you are right the entitymode.xml can be removed but i when i add it im thinking to add a new filed to posterminalinterntx entity to store pos paid reason instead of store it in the reasoncomment field i have already created some enumeration into demoposdata.xml but it is still not been used there are still a lot of things that has been not implemented or not working so contribution from other people are welcome removing the hardcoded value pos1 into webposevents.java at line is something still to be done im thinking to add a combo box after logged in to choose the posterminalid but i didnt get the time to do it thanks marco
716,u
717,i did not think about using the system tables
718,patch with fix to catch more bad variables
719,patches on xercesj1365 supersede the ones attached here
720,joseph
721,ivan thanks a lot for the patch few comments patch does not apply cleanly many hunk failure while applying patch hunk failed at hunk failed at hunk failed at hunk failed at hunk failed at hunk failed at hunk failed at hunk failed at hunk failed at could you please regenerate on the correct trunk code base testbookkeeperhacheckpoints.java tostring i can see setupcluster code almost duplicates with teststandbycheckpoints how about extracting configuration setup alone to protected method in teststandbycheckpoints and override in testbookkeeperhacheckpoints set the above configurations and give the call to super USER_MENTION public static void shutdownbk throws exception bkutil.teardown could you please add null condition for bkutil also correct the not completed nmy review will continue review
722,against such heavy committing myself without some consensus to do so
723,for the delay was away
724,for the superslow uptake on this the new job is using up all of my limited brain resources
725,for that
726,you mean to reference hadoop8562 hadoop8952 was never committed although apparently a typo during the checkin of hadoop8562 accidentally referenced it
727,is stuck
728,committed this to trunk branch2 and branch2.2 yingda thank you for the patch chuan thank you for help with the code review
729,looks good one minor comment planhelper.loadstorefinder may better be planhelper.loadstorenativefinder
730,to trunk
731,the patch looks good to me ill wait for hudson to check this in we are good to go for rc now thanks rakesh
732,yes were aware of the recurrence
733,you very much for your positive review and for improving the patch also a small correction to your previous comment it should be unit tests included in her patch as you know im one of the girls in this years gsoc program it was a great experience to collaborate with you and i thank you for everything
734,ill look into this
735,works fine it probably could have been done in another valve like the policy conetxt valve but this is a reasonable solution as well thanks
736,will do thanks for the review and good questions and the whole idea EMO_POS
737,thanks namit
738,good thanks george
739,looks good once it is committed i will deploy it thanks sourygna
740,cases for geomultidist function add this and solr.2155.p3.patch
741,just committed this thanks amareshwari
742,opened lucene3595 thanks i committed this to trunk and backported to nice iterations EMO_POS heavy committing
743,
744,sorry
745,parseledgerconfig did throw an ioexception since the bug is found in hub server topic cant be acquired due to hub server cant closing such kind ledger if we dont add code in ledgeropenop we have to find all such kind ledgers and handle them manually maybe delete them throwing ioexception here is ok for me but i am not sure do we need to keep backward compatibility to handle produced by old version what is your opinion
746,areek new patch looks great ill commit shortly
747,henry
748,well many thanks anyways oleg
749,so we can add isalreadyexpiring and if true sorry it should be so we can add isalreadyexpiring and if flase we can go with expireifonline
750,for being confusing
751,for sweet patch erik
752,review comments thanks vinod
753,you please address the findbugs warning inconsistent synchronization i did a quick look at your patch and i am a bit confused by the implementation of setsignaled i realize that you did not really change the code at all but is there a reason that the parameter is ignored if you dont know i can look into it myself
754,of sucks
755,if more return false i was about to submit this same patch today but i see you beat me to it EMO_POS thanks mark
756,to trunk thanks francis
757,typo in title
758,ideas thanks alexey ive updated the test patch
759,just committed this thanks arun
760,patch removes tohtml.xsl and adds configuration_to_docbook_section.xsl the latter generates a docbook section from our hbasedefault.xml using mavenxmlplugin that runs before the docbook plugin our book then xincludes the generated file the patch includes this modification too patch includes a edit of our book which adds a preface an index an appendix that talks of configuarion another on compression etc
761,attila i fixed the already
762,sorry
763,agree im planning to look into whirr370 later this month but i cant provide a timeline for it
764,just glanced through in general this is similar to the hack patch i used exploring lucene4089 though i just used a the part i didnt like when exploring was more related to how term dictionary are separated divisor generalize this into something simple like a of codec parameters that you set on split divisor from dont load terms index define these as constants where they belong i got unhappy here in the splitting part because i wanted the divisor part in termsindexreaderbase but that doesnt extend fieldsproducer where i wanted the dont load part and wrap the terms dict instead its backwards and terms dict wraps the termsindexreaderbase maybe we should fix that too i think this confusing the way it is but i didnt look at how difficult this would be but i think maybe i was trying to tackle too much at once still as an untyped parameter i thought it would be useful to fix the semantics all in one break rather than causing confusion down the road
765,revision merged to branch1.4 for
766,attached the file to the wrong issue
767,tri those files looks good i cursorily checked only.commonuilabels.xml.patch but from their sides i guess the others are good as well but done from the ofbiz roo directory its the main ofbiz directory where you fine the license and apache2_header files anyway not a big deal i will try to apply them as is and will let you know you dont have to remove the old files as you can see they are now grayed and its good that you checked the grant license box thanks
768,found the root cause of the problem will add a patch
769,old xml here is the used one und
770,patch applied at revision r437600 thanks a lot for this enhancement please verify that the problem is fully fixed as you expected
771,thanks for the slides
772,ravi
773,for the missing class
774,im trying to say is that its pretty easy to end up in propagation failure hell here or change something else that blows things up for use cases that are not foreseen
775,patch with thanks to scott
776,to trunk thank you for the patch erik
777,for trouble i didnt realize that port and context path is configured via pax web cxf bundle configuration in servicemix
778,think clearing private fields should work in all jvms since thats what the call to is for those fields were final too before derby23 and it looks like modifying final fields via reflection didnt work prior to java even when calling setaccessible first the tests also fail on both sun and ibm
779,the regression tests ran cleanly with the patch committed revision thanks for fix ed
780,thanks dave
781,very sorry
782,this affects version too
783,love a solution thats simpler and easier to understand than the original
784,alexei
785,would suck
786,this was assigned to you since months
787,v4 changes look good thanks
788,in revision the change should get published in a few hours
789,sorry EMO_NEG thanks
790,to trunk thanks johnny
791,can access the patch deletion from manage attachments right next to the attachment list if you cant access it let me know which patches need to be deleted
792,bad
793,i forgot to change the priority of this one
794,contact me if you need any clarifications
795,edgar for finding this one
796,believe this is now fixed the test case itself was the problem missing suffix of ull or ll for unix and ui64 or i64 for windows i am closing the issue
797,clearoutgoingqueues and put seems access to localqueuefornextiteration concurrently
798,board comment URL
799,the conversion of the time out interval from seconds to milliseconds using longs in the gettimeout method avoids the overflow could still add additional methods to the session api if desired
800,for thanks
801,looks like it needs rebased onto trunk the posted patch includes generated code please remove please add javadoc for the new classes and new public methods on existing classes introduces a block containing nontrivial branching logic can this be refactored with simpler clearer break conditions introduces new configuration can this be added to documented in
802,an attachment trivial patch that fixes this bug
803,i have been watching ofbiz1453 with interest i approve of the issue and implementation and didnt have anything to add so i havent been involved the thing i have been thinking about is that theres some assumptions to be made here for pricing and the type of question i.e multiselect questions should display the absolute price im also trying to work over some other scenarios ill clean up what i have an submit a patch tomorrow
804,to trunk thanks sushanth
805,thanks
806,made this stupid rule
807,i just committed this
808,the current behavior is incorrect i just didnt want you disappointed EMO_POS if you create your singleton jira patch before this one is applied then just include them together and close this bug i agree that commit rights would make this simpler and supplying patches is the primary way to gain commit rights so you are on the right path regardless what happens with pax web EMO_POS
809,sorry folks wrong project
810,to reproduce issue
811,should be path p6 pluto1.1.0taglibel.diff
812,an idiot theres nothing wrong with the readme.txt
813,did you get a chanse to try this out it seems to work fine for me and i plan to pop it in the trunk in a few days i think ill have to add a warning of some kind in runtime though as it could slow down the index a bit if the reader is way fragmented
814,by rob approve for
815,victor thanks alot for your help testing this issue would be good to know if it works on centos too kind regards bob
816,dont see that he fixed anything for ts2216 are you thinking of his commit for ts1988 i was going to try that
817,i was thinking these changes public static authresult reason user user permission.action action table return new reason user action table null null public static authresu
818,an idiot
819,see what you mean i didnt make the distinction between zero values and missing values but i am actually using a preferenceinferrer that fills in for missing values when i do that the break still happens before the other dimensions are included in the calculations of sumx or sumy
820,tomas
821,i forgot to mention this is for the future branch
822,sorry for frequently updating the issue title and contents
823,
824,you ivan
825,that ok for this file i have no idea how to do the svn move now after ive made all the changes already EMO_POS
826,is always a really bad way to design software
827,for the patch richard applied to luni module at repo revision r418009 please check that the patch was applied as you expected
828,this suck
829,fingers
830,like the testpatch build ran before hadoop7753 was integrated in the snapshot build ill wait half an hour or so and retrigger this testpatch meanwhile should be good to review
831,stuck with ie6 unfortunately
832,bad
833,rev thanks jose
834,to thanks for the backport jeff thanks for the review lars
835,just committed this thanks ari
836,good well postpone hbase2993 til then thanks
837,vasily the patch was applied to bti branch at r615105 please check that the patch was applied as you expected
838,florent where is the code you extracted
839,to todd and colin for the suggestions this is much cleaner im still looking for pointers on where to go for my checksum bytewrangling now in fseditlogop getrawchecksum
840,created a class that extends updaterequestprocessor which logs calls to each method in the console output youll see that only the processadd methods are called when using the dih in debug mode and the user checks verbose and commit ive attached the solr configuration that can be used to replicate the issue im assuming that once lucene commits the files the updaterequestprocessor.processcommit method should be called too package org.apache.solr.handler.dataimport import java.io.ioexception import org.apache.solr.update.addupdatecommand import org.apache.solr.update.commitupdatecommand import org.apache.solr.update.deleteupdatecommand import org.apache.solr.update.mergeindexescommand import org.apache.solr.update.rollbackupdatecommand import org.apache.solr.update.processor.updaterequestprocessor import org.slf4j.logger import org.slf4j.loggerfactory class used to show the interaction between the dih process and the updaterequestprocessor chain public class updaterequestprocessortest extends updaterequestprocessor protected static final logger log public next public void finish throws ioexception called super.finish public void cmd throws ioexception called public void cmd throws ioexception called public void cmd throws ioexception called public void cmd throws ioexception called public void cmd throws ioexception called package org.apache.solr.handler.dataimport import org.apache.solr.request.solrqueryrequest import org.apache.solr.request.solrqueryresponse import org.apache.solr.update.processor.updaterequestprocessor import org.apache.solr.update.processor.updaterequestprocessorfactory factory used to instantiate the updaterequestprocessortest class in the updaterequest processor chain public class updaterequestprocessortestfactory extends updaterequestprocessorfactory public updaterequestprocessor getinstance solrqueryrequest req solrqueryresponse rsp updaterequestprocessor next return new nov pm org.apache.solr.core.solrcore execute info nov pm org.apache.solr.core.solrcore execute info nov pm org.apache.solr.core.querysenderlistener newsearcher info querysenderlistener done nov pm newsearcher info loading spell index for spellchecker default nov pm org.apache.solr.core.solrcore registersearcher info registered new searcher searcherUSER_MENTION main nov pm org.apache.solr.core.solrcore execute info nov pm org.apache.solr.core.solrcore execute info nov pm org.apache.solr.handler.dataimport.dataimporthandler processconfiguration info processing configuration from solrconfig.xml nov pm org.apache.solr.handler.dataimport.dataimporter loaddataconfig info data configuration loaded successfully nov pm org.apache.solr.handler.dataimport.dataimporter verifywithschema info id is a required field in solrschema but not found in dataconfig nov pm org.apache.solr.handler.dataimport.dataimporter dofullimport info starting full import nov pm org.apache.solr.handler.dataimport.solrwriter readindexerproperties info read solr2914testcase.properties nov pm org.apache.solr.handler.dataimport.logtransformer transformrow info processing nov pm org.apache.solr.handler.dataimport.updaterequestprocessortest processadd info processadd called nov pm org.apache.solr.core.solrdeletionpolicy oninit info solrdeletionpolicy.oninit segments_g nov pm org.apache.solr.core.solrdeletionpolicy updatecommits info newest commit nov pm org.apache.solr.handler.dataimport.logtransformer transformrow info processing nov pm org.apache.solr.handler.dataimport.updaterequestprocessortest info processadd called nov pm org.apache.solr.handler.dataimport.logtransformer transformrow info processing nov pm org.apache.solr.handler.dataimport.updaterequestprocessortest info processadd called nov pm org.apache.solr.handler.dataimport.logtransformer transformrow info processing nov pm org.apache.solr.handler.dataimport.updaterequestprocessortest info processadd called nov pm org.apache.solr.handler.dataimport.logtransformer transformrow info processing nov pm org.apache.solr.handler.dataimport.updaterequestprocessortest info processadd called nov pm org.apache.solr.handler.dataimport.docbuilder finish info import completed successfully nov pm org.apache.solr.handler.dataimport.solrwriter readindexerproperties info read solr2914testcase.properties nov pm org.apache.solr.handler.dataimport.solrwriter persist info wrote last indexed time to solr2914testcase.properties nov pm org.apache.solr.handler.dataimport.docbuilder execute info time taken nov pm org.apache.solr.core.solrcore execute info
841,new patch uses as suggested
842,modify any testcases because its just some minor typo fixes
843,tricky thing with all the stacktraces we have as of now is that they dont seem to be the cause of the issue something is eating all the memory and as a consequence stuff starts to go wrong in arbitrary places we need to find whatever is eating the memory in the first place it might be very well be releated to the security provider can you try to run a memory profiler and see whether you can spot what is holding all the memory
844,attached patch adds a test case to restrictedvtitest that shows that the predicate is not pushed in the following query select s_r from t group by s_r having s_r only the rows with s_r have to be returned by the table function integerlist so pushing the predicate could be useful committed the new test case to trunk with revision
845,george the fix looks fine many thanks
846,to and trunk thanks for the patch jimmy thanks for the review andy
847,i missed this basic case thanks for pointing out i will cancel this patch
848,
849,think id rather have a cl option so it can still raise an error if you think say just one node is down but a second goes offline briefly as you run the loader but skipdeadnodes would also be reasonable
850,thanks for the patch EMO_POS
851,ive reading the specification and cant find any reference to transient session in node.lock do you mean that node.lock dont modify transient session because it performs a node.save internally there is no need to call save whether an implementation internally calls save is an implementation detail theres no need to call save means that there are no transient modifications which need to be saved by the client my english is a little bad an sometimes perhaps i dont use the correct words and cant express my ideas in the rigth way no problem most committers and a lot of people on the list are nonnative english speaking EMO_POS
852,
853,api at the thrift client you are referring
854,just committed this thanks prachi
855,would love to have it right now for storm too if you want me to sign up as a use case i am happy to
856,my bad the posted patch is from a completely wrong branch of my git repo i had not realized i ran the testpatch against a branch not branch1
857,
858,EMO_POS best regards fabian
859,forgot to mention this try to switch the tabs a second time the first click on tab b will correctly render content b but switching back to tab a and then again back to tab b fails to render content b
860,revision
861,to demonstrate that i cant reproduce this
862,should this be ok to commit to trunk thanks
863,thank you for the commit harsh mitch thank you for providing the detailed bug report
864,afraid one cant extract the text from the given pdfs both are using fonts with a non human readable encoding and as there isnt included any mapping youll get rubbish instead of the text even the acrobat reader cant extract the text
865,jacques ill upload another file
866,to trunk thanks for the patch bryan thanks for the review chunhui
867,for being patient devaraj
868,an attachment fix misspelled function names
869,about the noise was trying out the precommit job
870,for the quick patching donald
871,back to committed revision
872,to wish list since we wont include this in the upcoming g release
873,task was done before the branch was created this task is now resolved
874,thanks for the patch looking forward to it landing in
875,all resolved tickets from or older
876,with owb1.1.4
877,fart
878,some more progress with kryo plan serialization checkpointing wip patch
879,for the noise i forgot to grant the license to previous attachment for inclusion in asf works thanks
880,missing package.html some files need to be removed svn del EMO_NEG if on windows you really need to remove it before applying the patch otherwise it will just keep using jexlnode.java for a class named jexlnode the patch does not apply cleanly especially uberspectimpl introspector the best approach ive found yet is to force apply updates even if patch thinks it may have already been applied then for each of them the rej content replacing the end of the original file with the content at the proper place a quick regexp replace with to get rid of these and it should be ok i wish i had a way to generate patches guaranteed to apply a tool that would apply the patch to the original file if rejects are found recreate a patch for this file that replaces the whole content delete all original content add all new content with the new one
881,will figure out the details and do the port later this week if you dont get to it first
882,far as the query shit i have no idea if solrdispatchfilter or whatever do or whatever and maybe restore after
883,same appears to be try for case_studies.xml community.xml and zookeeper.xml should those not be copied for some other reason
884,dont think there is any sense in this who cares
885,about that tiredness
886,i committed this thanks hong
887,thats some freaky shit
888,to god im not a total idiot
889,look into the namespace handler thanks yes i should have added the different event handling support to the todo above i need to think more about this and look into the camel code a bit more using just the endpoint api i couldnt create routes on the fly hence the polling consumer approach ill keep hacking away at in in my toolbox when customer needs dictate am i missing something in your approach how would i do this then in the xml dsl using your approach i think virtual routing is a known limitation of camel when you start to deploy large scale systems out of curiosity have you seen camel ever been deployed with of routes routes files i think this would have fd and thread overkill problems everything repeats itself EMO_POS
890,for the delay and thanks for the good work works like a charm
891,memory
892,thanks
893,now that i think about it it may crap out when coming back to read even on a recovered file
894,for the commit
895,what i
896,to alldevelopers group which has this permission
897,site was already taken offlne
898,but your testcase doesnt fail on my machine it gives me two counters in two windows the second one with a ten second start delay winxp jdk tomcat t4.0.2
899,olivier does all the great work here i assigned the issue to him thank you
900,we need to fix it EMO_POS
901,some variations
902,ran gridmix just to be sure that the performance is not hit huge because of the locking business and the results turned out to be in the same range of secs of our previous runs of fairscheduler without this patch i also had a look at the patch looks good
903,thanks namit
904,is pretty trivial just adds three asserts to testpath testnormalize
905,EMO_POS
906,fine thanks
907,sorry
908,for finding and fixing the patch applied at r474719
909,cool i especially like the upload file option
910,lars sorry i wasnt watching this before so i missed your work til you mentioned it on the hbase jira ill try to take a look at this this week feel free to grab me on irc if you have specific questions
911,regards richard
912,pretty unlikely
913,kickstart for our new wiki
914,good discussion on that project and lru cache in general in hbase1460 if you missed it
915,sure
916,i missed the overwrite keyword
917,damn i thought it was fixed guillaume
918,for the delay im recreating the mirror now
919,bad had a typo in the subscription email
920,ive now ported the fix to and deployed a new snapshot could someone give it a try to make sure it really is fixed so that we can close this off for thanks
921,is only a problem with exceptions from java
922,commented out the jaastest gbean since it seems to work fine without it if its necessary then please uncomment it
923,wow welcome to linux hell
924,thanks
925,location selection is very cool
926,tom the change in your patch looks good latest patch just updates two tests ill commit this if hudson comes back ok thanks eli
927,fine for me and the code looks good great work i did not run the integration tests what do you think
928,an attachment strutsconfig
929,randy committed r
930,for this patch looks good
931,ramin the patch looks good except i think it would be good to give its own sqlstate starting with xie instead of reusing the existing store file_exists message also it would be good to have test cases for writing the lob files kathey
932,very busy for the moment so i didnt know when i d be able to the change myself so if you can your contribution would be one more time really appreciated
933,a patch for branch security
934,you carol
935,is addendum to fix sorry about build breakage
936,maven
937,investigations doron
938,the patch is great just that it should not have been categories as a bug EMO_POS
939,me for stolen assignement
940,did agree to produce a hive release in less then months that did not use the npath trademark this jira is to specifically address that
941,revision thanks patrick
942,to the design of this feature i cant edit comments because of permissions so adding another comment in case the seconds field needs more than bit the first vint is regardless of whether is zero or not
943,i do not have a working instance of svn so i cant create a proper patch i have attached the modified source file org.apache.tuscany.sca.assembly.builder.impl.compositewirebuilderimpl.java i have commented the place where i modified a single line with fix for jira bug tuscany1930
944,times out i suspect the wrong version of java is used for subprocess
945,it
946,meet the same problem on eclipse recently but havent figured out how to get through
947,the goal of the test was very good
948,to jakob korherr for this patch
949,for the explanation
950,do have a very large of rows on many nodes
951,at datastaxs debian packages the change didnt make its way in digging deeper its only on the cassandra1.2 branch can someone it to cassandra2.0 and trunk thanks blair
952,christian i just tried to apply your patch but i found there is no pom.xml in the camelsoap module can you submit it to the jira btw did you run the test with jdk
953,rewrite testfsck so that minidfscluster is shutdown properly between each test
954,weird
955,feedback thanks im glad you found the issue and the solution
956,applied the patch thanks
957,this is gonna take me a lot of work to raise
958,problem is that it builds awt and that requires some dependencies
959,dont want oneoffs like this to become lost and forgotten
960,thanks tim
961,in release branch in r605105 leaving open until fix with other pending changes is ported back to trunk
962,out some fixes to the sstii bytes tracker getting out of sync the underlying stream and did some cleanup to make the versions less divergent also adds parallel compaction testing to lazilycompactedrowtest clitest and defstest generate compaction loads in defstests case on the migrations cf havent dug into clitest as much that break parallel enabled although the test doesnt actually fail argh havent figured out whats causing that and havent come up with a way to reproduce in a real test yet the defstest does mix iteration in the merge which may be relevant bq im also no proposing to complicate things youre right poor choice of words on my part latest gives the merge executor a synchronousqueue i think thats a better way to cut worstcase than the deserializer for the reason given previously bq if instanceof business is a bit error agreed added getcolumncount reset to icountablecolumniterator subinterface bq say how multithreaded_compaction is different from concurrent_compactors and that multithread_compaction is likely only useful for ssds in cassandra.yaml done bq the bytesread race should also be fixed in compactioniterable done bq i would have put the code in compactedrow.close at the end of the lcr.write instead of adding a new method as it avoids forgetting calling close i did consider that but it feels weird to me to have write implicitly call close i guess we could just change the method name EMO_POS bq we can make precompactedrow.removedeletedandoldshards a public method and use it in pci.mergetask done
963,the minor nits thanks sid
964,aki i strongly suggest you write a persistence system test both for client and server side which can expose the problem you mentioned and also verify your fix works actually we already have serverpersistencetest and clientpersistencetest in i think you can add yours in those two classes btw your suggestion seems ok for me thanks freeman
965,for looking into this suresh
966,rick for applaying the patch
967,commit it today evening
968,excited to see progress being made here but i have to agree with joan the security of this concerns me even with the new sandbox.js youre putting together
969,ken patch applied to trunk r480575
970,way lies metadata hell
971,it back in if you think different
972,if this spams things however its unlikely that ill work on these
973,bad is this
974,anurag thanks for the preliminary peek at this patch looks good i like the way you handled the optional inclusion of the jdbc4specific classes in the jar file i recommend adding class and method comments to the test classes so that reviewers will know what these tests are supposed to stress thanks for the explanation of why you disabled the securitymanager and for commenting the property file accordingly when we do commit this patch lets leave the jira open to remind us to reenable the securitymanager after mustang fixes its bug cheersrick
975,james does the rest of the build work with this patch seems like this should work with the old rhel5 toolchain but i didnt look closely
976,in subversion repository as of r1328492
977,dont have strong opinions about it either way
978,i used to be the latter but then i went to law school and got a degree in this shit
979,just committed this thanks mahadev
980,colm my comments are the same see above URL ive not gone through to see if youve addresses any of comments but a quick scan shows that you did not pick up and so ill wait for the next version of the patch EMO_POS thank you gary
981,andreas thank you for the information shall try the same and upload the patch shortly thanks regards ravikiran mane
982,for reporting solved
983,very much for your response i want to thank your team for the great job theyve done building a superior opensource solution not only do i use but i also promote it everywhere i go i just did a handson lab using jspwiki to create qwiki web apps for people at devcon it got excellent reviews i promote this as an enterprise opensource solution if a company wanted to purchase a support contract or services for a production implementation of the product who should they contact thanks again jim mason URL do you yahoo tired of spam yahoo mail has the best spam protection around URL
984,the bug description sorry for the noise
985,ashish
986,avi
987,george thanks a lot the fix works fine EMO_POS best regards richard
988,the patch at revision
989,hate me just throwing this out there
990,i am on the fence about it we actually do not need all the libs i included having them in a tarball sounds good but making a maven repo for only this purpose seems to be a lot of work should we attempt to factor out the hbase commonality immediately or commit the overlapping code and then do refactoring as a followup im fine either way i can give suggestions on how to create the reusable abstract bases and where to if you can specify specific instances then sure the code may be the same but that one nuance is going to make the abstractions confusing and useless i await further review
991,patch really helped
992,for the info david
993,an attachment xml source with one entry that can trigger error
994,for the patch mubarak
995,shit man i think i found the issue
996,look good could you run regression tests with your patch and let us know how it goes thanks kathey
997,looks good
998,this patch is so damn large already i wont be making anymore changes to this other than bug fixes
999,noticeable performance impact with stress.py defaults or with one column per row in periodic mode
1000,wont get to it so lets go ahead in general we should push things to a version if we want to get it out in time for ga
1001,thanks daniel were actually cool with either updating it to e9ff8c4928 or flipping the write bit and well push the delta ourselves whatevers the fastest to get to writeable EMO_POS thanks tim
1002,was a pretty stupid idea to use a static array of instances for quorumopmonitor
1003,revision
1004,EMO_POS will have a look
1005,great thanks tinny
1006,for the finding andrey createdir is recursive would be nice to write it in iterative manner would filesystem.mkdirs do the job
1007,for the late review have a few minor what happens if have instances of consumers with the same clientid in the same jvm does one of them fail because it fails to register metrics ditto for producers consumertopicstats what if a topic is named alltopics we use to handle this by adding a in topic specific stats zookeeperconsumerconnector do we need to validate groupid clientid does the clientid length need to be different from topic length abstractfetcherthread when building a fetch request do we need to pass in brokerinfo as part of the client id brokerinfo contains the source broker info and the fetch requests are always made to the source broker
1008,youre right
1009,for accepting this patch im sorry i wasnt sensitive to the brace convention already in the file i probably could have javadocd the inner class too EMO_POS i didnt think about the lack of thread safety of the simpledateformat class good catch so this counts as a bugfix by markt format was being used in an unsynchronized way prior to this patch as well as an enhancement by me EMO_POS if dbcp typically uses localized error messages id be happy to provide another patch that localizes the exceptions message
1010,im gonna hold off on lucene2771 until we figure this one out because it would make your getsequentialsubreaders in the case quite heavy without modifications sorry i was wrong on this i totally forgot the norms cache is lazyloaded always in that patch ill commit lucene2771 it shouldnt affect this
1011,me a few seconds to get it but then i realized how awesome it is
1012,the hivemodule.xml snippet from the previous post should read sorry for any potential confusion
1013,thanks for applying the patch and fixing the formatting
1014,ported to in rev
1015,irritated the hell out of me too but i didnt realise it was configurable in the launch file
1016,only its the first one in my life im seeing multiple ways of closing the same thing it also conceals programming errors
1017,this tool is cool
1018,john i would agree using object notification is probably a cleaner way to do this
1019,was not aware of being required to call that method
1020,you for the patch xuefu i have committed it to trunk
1021,really sucks that there is now way currently to include transitive dependencies
1022,to and trunk thanks for the patch chunhui thanks for the review lars
1023,and rick thanks for your feedbacks i will take care of the comments posted by knut rick thanks for adding lint directive it will be good to see the error from the compiler
1024,revision for ipf fix
1025,to ernst fastl for adding this
1026,sijie
1027,simo sorry for delay i had a quick check to org.kohsuke.metainfservices it seems to fit all our needs use the quickest and more standard way to declare plugins in a transparent fashion i dont have any objection with this patch for me it is ok thanks mic
1028,patch looks good
1029,a lot for your help
1030,oliver sorry for the late response i havent had any time to look into this again maybe it was a misuse on my side after all since i havent been working on the project i encountered the behavior in for months this issue might as well be closed
1031,edited patch was messed up stupid sed
1032,patch fixes the dir permissions
1033,the current behavior is irritating
1034,
1035,to fix in future release
1036,just committed this thanks jeff
1037,code review
1038,an attachment testcase for normalizespacebug
1039,too bad though since clearing out commitlog segments is easily done
1040,this looks good to me existing configurations will still work with this patch so there are no compatibility concerns
1041,is really confusing sometimes
1042,patch looks good the checkstyle.xml is specified in
1043,did it works fine with and ios6 thanks dominic
1044,you set this did the trick for me EMO_POS
1045,to master and branch thanks klaus
1046,error
1047,i miss this bug is same str2372 i change resolution to invalid
1048,leon thanks ill take a look anyway i thought of refactoring this parsing mechanism we can do better EMO_POS cheers sascha
1049,didnt mean to leave that in
1050,anahita your patch tested successfully
1051,just did an amd linux build and all i did was remove from the list of libraries since we dont really need at all dont you think a better patch would be to remove that directory all together
1052,dismaxrequesthandler and standardrequesthandler are both deprecated and replaced with searchhandler
1053,for the quick fix works perfect
1054,is being a little buggy
1055,
1056,so much knut anders
1057,good pending hudson
1058,thanks xiao li
1059,done some modifications and checked with valgrind and reduce around bytes of a loss with echo sample regs lahiru
1060,the hell do they deliver duration if they cannot instantiate it
1061,it seemed it didnt work
1062,looking through datetools now and cant help but want to clean it up some one thing i see that is odd is the use of a calendar in resolution the first two lines look like this right now resolution date date calinstance.gettime instead it can simply be date date new resolution secondly i think a good deal of logic can be cleaned up in the other methods instead of a bunch of ifelse statements that is a bad code smell most of the logic of of those methods could be put into resolution and be made tighter
1063,good catch
1064,hausherr hello finally it works i just downloaded the revision and bulded it with ant and added the new to my projects build path it printed very well thank you very much
1065,you
1066,elliot did you forget to add failedsanitycheckexception to the patch if the same as in ill just add it at commit will the new exception cause compatibility issues in old and clients i dont think so just making sure
1067,i have no objection lets wait
1068,at revision thanks maja
1069,suran the new catalogs_b.patch looks very good
1070,patch to trunk with revision
1071,now we dont have restpath only service path
1072,all resolved tickets from or older
1073,didnt do that because that seems bad in hive so i returned null from the operation
1074,leading to root context of default plan
1075,app developers should always explicitly set it based on their application my guess is that a large enough group of people take the defaults that it matters
1076,forget last comment it is incorrect
1077,i just tried it and this change works when the users classpath variable is unset ive just committed this thanks michael
1078,could not reproduce this on the latest build so closing
1079,thank you so much
1080,trunk revision now backporting
1081,applied thanks
1082,thanks
1083,hours gone
1084,commits in comments
1085,hell i think i found one problem with turning a bignum into anything else
1086,lgtm to get rid of the extra logging and to kill the child process
1087,if you backport this to you cant use any of the very good point didnt thought about back porting at all bq im not sure you need a separate searcherholder class cant you reuse indexreaders i guess i did not see the simplicity the reader offers blind due to EMO_POS bq i think there are some thread safety issues this is weird on my dev machine and in the patch it is not synchronized on the machine i run the tests it is anyway you are right i changed the code to be compatible with using will attache in a minute
1088,i didnt experience the problem with karaf commands when using fuse esb based on karaf but i did have problems with aries blueprint when i tried to instantiate some of our own beans as an osgi service workaround for me was to remove the aries proxy bundle shipped with fuse esb and install aries proxy after i did that and restarted the container the problem was resolved for me
1089,as well patch looks good like the javadoc we get lots of users asking what those exceptions mean
1090,backport for a different jira of mine is failing and i want to see if i can figure out what might be wrong there before doing a new backport
1091,as a duplicate of rol1642
1092,a lot subin
1093,i just committed your latest patch keep up the good work URL
1094,did nothing special my understanding was that simply trying to test under jdeveloper caused the problem your report says removing xmlparserv2 causes jdeveloper not to start is there something else i need to do to cause the problem fyi i created a maven project with the code above as the only application i then imported the application which was a bit frustrating as it didnt seem to accomplish much i then had to manually add the log4j jars into the classpath along with and had to make a couple of other changes so that it knew how things were laid out in the project i then ran the application from jdeveloper and it ran fine
1095,sure i want the transient inability to clean up some local log or other trivial task to kill a whole pig job
1096,branch and trunk thanks for the patch mikhail
1097,try this patch thanks a lot
1098,thanks sambavi
1099,guys
1100,new patch by addressing review comments from amar
1101,of hive3869
1102,didnt see anything in subversion
1103,asf grant
1104,yes when that fragment is part of an rtf file it provokes the exception so if you could put it into a valid rtf file it should throw the exception
1105,to trunk thanks enis
1106,guys
1107,
1108,i took martins comment to mean the patch was committed and issue closed which certainly discarded all the patches the first time around
1109,added a patch to fix the deadlock issue i used the same type of approach as brian ewins did with his patch so the addition of some of his concepts could be applied to fix them both at the same time reference of his patch suggestion URL
1110,for the patch error i have created a patch both for and attached it in
1111,anyone please review the attached patch thanks
1112,mmap and simplefs directoryfactory impls didnt include the directiolinuxdirectory yet since that still seems highly experimental
1113,course it could EMO_POS doh
1114,is bad
1115,thanks
1116,patch file is attached here to address these problems many files have been touched sorry for it but im sure there are more files than these that have i18n problems id like to dig more into it as soon as these critical ones are resolved
1117,looks god thanks for making it better
1118,good to me
1119,if you want to make these optimizations fix the apis so its intuitive otherwise no way
1120,released
1121,is a silly one
1122,alexeys right the original fix was invalid please undo all the patches sorry
1123,just committed this thanks hairong
1124,on earth would it match anything you have not even touched the apache install
1125,am in the middle of reviewing both of these patches and noticed that they are related and wont mix well
1126,to make matters worse since the mid1990s ive been offering pro bono advice to nonprofit foundations whose members insult me regularly and assume im an amateur
1127,are two sections of the diff that dont seem related USER_MENTION USER_MENTION USER_MENTION USER_MENTION this was part of hadoop2901 which was recently committed the patch no longer applies cleanly could you regenerate it
1128,paulex the fix looks good thanks best regards andrew
1129,thanks yuntao
1130,review the submitted patch thanks
1131,bad uploaded the wrong patch
1132,good checking this in
1133,said going to fix this in his buildfauxton branch but like to explain this for posterity make indeed throws this error i suggest it is a grunt.js error but the way we use autotools in particular in how we use autotools for packaging each file that is supposed to end up in our final apachecouchdbx.y.z.tar.gz tarball needs to be marked as such in a makefile.am for fauxton that means we maintain a list of fauxton files in specified as fauxton_files so on in that list there is a line e.g where we say that file is supposed to go into the release tarball that file however does not exist at the time is run so make complains i assume the solution is that make needs to call grunt at some point to turn into and i think that is what noah is doing in his branch i just wanted to explain why this a make error
1134,the federated build is still working out kinks
1135,someone wants to take this over thats cool im unlikely to have time in the next week and a half though
1136,looks good to me
1137,henry thanks for checking it out
1138,it is a dup thanks mike for taking care of this i planned to do this yesterday but didnt make it
1139,willem ive just tried the latest version from the trunk now everything works like a charm thank you very much for such a great help regards sergey
1140,thanks please commit this EMO_POS
1141,work this is awesome stuff
1142,im convinced sorry about the wait as an apology i have coded up the urlbased version in v3 havent actually tested it on nonlocal files though but it compiles EMO_POS
1143,like a good solution thanks for taking care of this uwe should we backport this to and which is easy
1144,thanks liyin
1145,weird
1146,damn
1147,is a bit too lax i think
1148,for the trouble
1149,just committed this thanks giri
1150,its not off the table but its moot unless we decide we want cqlsh intree at all
1151,the hell starts using our jira for typing lessons
1152,that looks good now much easier for the enduser
1153,think you made mistakes in ivy.xml
1154,a screenshot of local security policy console secpol.msc where users can add symbolic links privilege to their accounts
1155,the forcesync be volatile otherwise patch looks good make it volatile on commit
1156,for taking the time out to review the patch bryan yes the patch is ready for commit unless someone else is reviewing it too thanks again
1157,from in hopes that hdfs2342 did indeed fix testhdfsproxy.testhdfsproxyinterface
1158,is my fault didnt try other profiles yarn was broken as well works now
1159,thanks sambavi
1160,guys EMO_POS i also agree with hyunsiks suggestion i updated hadoop dependency to follow hadoop version of tajoproject check the patch again please
1161,to trunk thanks elliott
1162,to and trunk thanks
1163,ivan attach a new patch with noprefix
1164,are patches one for adjustexamplepaths.bat sh and the other a new file holding user libraries uima_lib uima_as_lib not sure where this should go
1165,by ryan baxter as revision
1166,here is the missing file im sorry for the delay regards eric
1167,we dont care for this in cases where we there is no node that is down
1168,reason not to commit this patch its been hanging around a long time
1169,committed thanks
1170,i ran makemaven target build failed with following error build failed warning could not find file to copy i dont see any pom files created in build directory
1171,to trunk thanks harish
1172,a ton for your review todd heres an updated patch which addresses all of your comments except the following bq in editlogfileinputstream why do we need to pass isinprogress as a boolean if its inprogress that means we dont know the lasttxid so it would be invalid_txid right so we can implement isinprogress by just comparing lasttxid because in the case of pretransactional elfis we pass in invalid_txid even though the log is not yet in progress im still working on producing an updated patch which also adds testing for the pending dn message queues
1173,if this is already merged can you change status to resolved
1174,please dont say that my reasoning is bad because it is not
1175,sorry i thought this ticket was about something else patch attached david would you give a try
1176,atul your patch is in trunk at r933169 i just added some mod for ofbiz layered lookups comments around changes as suggested sascha
1177,in qpid URL
1178,i agree it does seem that the presence of the proxyauthorization header on the already authenticated connection causes reauthentication so for ntlm to work the proxyauth header must be removed once authenticated i dont think either patch or handles this case unless in the case of patch the host also uses ntlm what we really need is a way to remove ntlm headers after the authentication has succeeded mike
1179,to trunk thank you lorand
1180,
1181,nice work this is a great idea and the patch looks good overall couple of points dont forget the apache header on the new errors class maybe do the grammar corrections on the counter error messages separately just so we keep the commits to a single issue each im not sure we need to retain the delegating formatvaluelist method in testdriver something to discuss as for using guava to do the string join i know mrunit used to have it as a dependency but this was removed in mrunit50 probably not worth bringing it back for such a simple method
1182,may cause conflicts but if your intent is to break system security you probably dont care
1183,divesh your patch is commited at revision
1184,upgrade to a recent version of jackrabbit see URL im afraid i cant say much about the risk
1185,stuff a good candidate to put on myfacescommonsutils so the user can just add the resource handler on its webapp facesconfig
1186,ahsan i noticed that there are some good links to suggestions for writing the best proposal from this page URL
1187,the recent facets work i think that as part of this issue we should do the following two things in addition to what i described above EMO_NEG make ordinalpolicy an enum with two constants its already hard to support just these two see lucene4610 and lucene4600 and its not at all clear how to support arbitrary ordinalpoilcyies that users will provide rather if one really wishes to encode only say levels and below he can extend facetfields and provide his own categorylistbuilder for the search side hell need to provide whatever will work for him i cannot even describe here what api exactly because of the complexity nuke pathpolicy one can extend facetfields and provide his own drilldownstream ill need to check about that one but it looks like we can get rid of it too
1188,it should be noted that the nosession filter only prevents new sessions from being created it allows access to any existing session that might have been created in another part of the application by the application developer
1189,though pig itself compiled fine and is ready to go the contrib projects owl zebra didnt compile i think because either it didnt download dependices of those projects or didnt include them in the build path ashutosh yes i did realize it and as you rightly guessed it is because the ivydependency list doesnt have some jars that are actually being used by contrib packages this is not an issue related to eclipseclasspath however there has to be a jira opened to solve this issue of downloading the missing jars by ivy can you please file a jira for this thanks
1190,lgtm bryan i believe assignee should be erik as the author of initial version of patch but i cant find him in drop box
1191,eventhough these are commented out
1192,committed to trunk thanks niraj
1193,for fixversion
1194,cool thanks stack
1195,want to integrate the sweet sweet logo andrew crafted
1196,found the reason why we observe different behaviors with the network server since you run with the default security manager you actually get derby.system.home set as a system property as a side effect see line ca line in networkservercontrol.java as part of the setup of the security manager i ran without the security manager so i did not get it set i do think though that the old behavior was buggy i cant see why one should need to set derby.system.home explicitly to get the autoboot behavior unless someone can explain why this should be so ill file a bug for that
1197,i was not able to create one difffile so i added for every build.xml an own diff
1198,confused
1199,for the patch
1200,steve gentle reminder as per your instructions about reviewing this patch thanks
1201,looks like a good cleanup to me i admit i didnt check all the changed lines in detail but the approach gets my EMO_POS
1202,the dtacloud wiki space
1203,a lot
1204,bad
1205,for the mess there i was just trying to port cfs and hive metastore too but those tests dont work right now so put it on hold getting it to work with cql3 column families is a priority for me right now so will come back to those later just for the hive handler please look at the cassupportsimplehive branch URL all the test cases whatever few they had pass there and it is working perfectly with storage column families
1206,must have looked at this before my morning coffee
1207,robbie would you mind reviewing this commit
1208,submit an diff against the v2.3.1 branch
1209,to trunk thanks for the patch doug
1210,build works for me now too looks like the missing snapshot has been published somewhere now
1211,trying to use hive performance benchmark i read readme file and followed step by step and finally i reached to the data generation part teragen has no problem but i face a problem with htmlgen i configured something to my own cluster vms and launched generatedata.py but it never finished i launched it about hours ago so i modified uservisits and rankings in config.txt to be smaller but it was also failed even it consumed very little resources when i saw top information in the ubuntu have you guys ever met this kinds of problems and if you have how did you solve this problem thank you so much
1212,be taken care of next releases
1213,mike
1214,very cool and so very committed thanks matthias this is awesome
1215,commented out the assertion for this test its not valid
1216,for figuring this one out and providing the patch jamie
1217,richard patch applied to nio_char module java.nio.charsetencoder at repo revision
1218,as i didnt grant asf license first time i attached it
1219,
1220,an attachment
1221,repeating this and the problem just gets worse
1222,patch applied at revision r430325 thanks a lot for this enhancement please verify that the problem is fully fixed as you expected
1223,im an idiot i used the wrong patch sigh
1224,take two uploaded wrong thing
1225,debugdll and releasedll build configurations for vs2005activemq didnt have the linker flag turned on
1226,got it thanks ivan for explanation
1227,this thanks
1228,is quite bad
1229,klaus
1230,arpana
1231,was released in but is now being reverted in due to overwhelming community feedback
1232,for applying the images please check and apply the patch ive submitted to for1008 since the changes required to resolve this issue involves files modified there it has to be applied first URL
1233,in hbase2156 after it was reopened
1234,like your change did not fix the findbugs but i think you need to suppress the findbugs warning hrs_request_parameter_to_http_header it is suppressed for jobdetails.jsp in mapreduce1185
1235,forgot to verify that this is inconsistant with mri its not
1236,like the elegant parser
1237,didnt look at the code until commit can you test making it hash to a long or a bytebuffer
1238,again
1239,the doc updates for the tuning guide please review and comment if these updates are ready to be committed
1240,thanks for helping narrow this down
1241,thanks hitesh
1242,to come in late some clarifications mr1 jt kills all running tasks on a tt when its deemed lost it also kills all completed maps on that tt for active jobs the tasks are marked killed rather than failed and thus dont count towards the job which is correct since it wasnt the jobs fault hope this helps
1243,now that i think of it we never had anything exposed via jmx for the rm looks like this is the first bean we are adding is that right i thought some of the work that thomas did on web services was also exposed via jmx no
1244,think its time to just close this issue
1245,just committed this thanks alejandro
1246,of no error is thrown in ie7 when title bar is clicked in window.xal example
1247,regards richard
1248,was able to download and extract URL just fine thanks for working on this myrna
1249,this is an automatically generated email to reply visit URL updated review request for hive changes address nings comments did the minimum change and the performance is acceptable we can try to remove empty path check if in future we see the latency is not good summary speedup addinputpaths this addresses bug hive2218 URL diffs updated diff URL testing yes thanks yongqiang
1250,for the noise
1251,food is very bad
1252,i dont really know much about namedspiloader but i think what youre suggesting how would we support factories loading unrelated classes like they can through resourceloader now assume theyre on the classpath and use class.forname it needs more discussion and input from uwe would help but it works like etc we use this already for codecs and postingsformats codec.forname codec.listallcodecs have a look at for the idea basically you register your classes in your jar file this way additional jar files e.g look at can load more classes so this could support some idea like or something simple like that so someone would not need to use org.apache.solr.analysis.xx namespace to be able to load their analyzer stuff easily they use whatever package they want and register in their meta_inf and added jar files other analysis jars are automatically available this way i think uwe mentioned this idea before though i think he had analyzers in mind e.g provide language code and get back analyzer or something anyway thats for another issue EMO_POS just something worth consideration if we want to make these modules really pluggable on the other hand we shouldnt use anything overkill if its not the right fit
1253,then EMO_POS
1254,good to me
1255,to both for these usability enhancements
1256,we are using jackrabbit to the content in my application please find the attached config files of my application best regards rk ocs l3 support
1257,this new patch is the correct one still learning the ropes EMO_POS
1258,guess we need to supply a tool to rename sstables files if anyone is on longer names we probably dont need to do anything i dont think anyone is really using names long enough for them to it the file system limit the goal of limiting the names is just so to prevent this from happening but there will be no other assumption that the names are short from the code i also dont think anything will prevent rolling upgrades do you had something in mind note i have a long flight ahead of me so i plan to update my last patch with both those changes as i still like the moving of all the directories handling in a dedicated class even if we dont support both layout
1259,patch looks good
1260,on intent from looking at what the patch fixes
1261,EMO_POS sorry about that
1262,about this
1263,if that was confusing
1264,unaryfunction might even be faster than all of these calls in a row
1265,this in the latest
1266,dhruba borthakur i am using the version i put namenode in safemode and then i executed the save editlogs are not corrupted can u please give exact scenario to reproduce this
1267,someone wants to work on this please go ahead i still plan to just no time yet
1268,nothing EMO_NEG are you serious about that
1269,dont have to ensure that the classloader knows groovy classes must do that
1270,say to hell with windows minority EMO_POS
1271,like a good idea but better to only fix in to keep more
1272,carlos this looks awesome lots of cool stuff
1273,progress on this issue
1274,to trunk thanks jarcec
1275,worked fine in jetspeed too
1276,for the report and sorry its taken so long to fix it
1277,is weird
1278,you done this n
1279,uma for looking at the jira i think it should work fine with bpofferservice registrationsucceeded synchronized will post a patch soon after verifying it
1280,thanks john
1281,the said method is not public since it returns workspace names regardless of user rights please note that the a session must only about workspaces it is actually allowed to access im working on a garbage collector for the data store the gc doesnt care about user rights or putting it another way it must be able to access all workspaces ideally id like to use a systemsession but you cant get one outside repositoryimpl or o.a.j.c package i.e is package private workspaceinfo is protected i understand that these apis shouldnt be public but theyre useful from within the core in my case for the gc im very interested in using another way to walk every workspace but this other way should guarantee that the repository wont shutdown during a walk operation ill check the solution thomas said hell be proposing but in the mean time that is what im using still i dont see why this apis arent public regards
1282,
1283,sure this was fixed by the time we released jruby
1284,so much sorry that this isnt in the appropriate place
1285,looks like the tests are failing especially testharfilesystem
1286,looks great thanks i replicated the database but cant figure out how to start the couchapp can you help cheers chris
1287,just hate having no clue what a file is really depending on EMO_POS
1288,you get a chance to try a patched build
1289,committed thanks jarek
1290,should be noted that the client driver already caches the lob lengths for both clobs and blobs i planning to go ahead with the patch for storestreamclob in the embedded driver
1291,this in once clears
1292,thanks a lot i suppose it will be in the next nightly build vbr johan
1293,there is an dependency please go to preferences ldap entry editor and enable the option show operational attributes
1294,looks good to me thanks
1295,patch should be relatively trivial but like i said i have no idea if there is other important stuff going on there or not
1296,i narrowed down the issue to chromes overzealous caching i was able to reproduce the problem on two separate computers in a simple project where i had upgraded from wicket to but due to testing before and after chrome had cached the buggy version of wicketajax.js from and did not detect that it changed with the update clearing the browser cache resolved the issue sorry about the bogus bug report
1297,reading this code i can see why this bug is happening after completing stage above when adding the new item the code does ordered cancelled quantity which equates to
1298,i dont quite understand this patch for instance you didnt mention bcprov above but you remove some references to it in and and confusingly the patch doesnt remove this seems a little inconsistent perhaps im missing something
1299,sweet im guessing you have an ide that does this if the tests pass commit this kinda crap goes out of date too fast
1300,yes yes imho
1301,applied thanks
1302,looks good will commit if the tests pass
1303,committed with revision d3a9688d00bd520dc1c9b3a40b229aa9b10c87f0
1304,v2.2 rebased to trunk latest
1305,that would be very bad design
1306,applied with thanks
1307,attached a patch to add one test for plaintext
1308,to use for delete check
1309,to trunk branch2 and branch2.1beta thanks jian
1310,a new issue and copied the patch there URL
1311,fixed
1312,sascha there is an overlap with ofbiz3843 could you please check thanks
1313,did you commit to both branch1.2 and branch1
1314,ts1513 spdy plugin crashes on connection close thanks for testing
1315,adrian
1316,is now resolved and pushed to npm as uses npms proxy configs in lazyload module
1317,alexei the patch is fine
1318,it seems that the patch cannot be applied on a few files e.g the cxfendpoint.java patch as it seems your patch is against an old version of the code e.g your patch uses the line USER_MENTION when trunk is USER_MENTION any chance you could do an svn update to ensure you are using the trunk then create the patch again please as right now i cant apply it
1319,to sqoop2 thanks jarcec
1320,for trunk fix
1321,you rock drew
1322,dont think this is a bug cachedsqlentityprocessor will execute the query only once and that is its usp if you dont want the caching then just use sqlentityprocessor
1323,committed this to trunk and branch thanks nigel tested via ant tar and ant package instead of hudson since most of the change was done via svn remove the patch only applies to build.xml
1324,for taking this patch looks good is this good to be committed
1325,much everything that fsnamesystem ie
1326,an attachment patch to manifest.mf
1327,dont think this is a bug you essentially moved files out from under a running instance something cassandra cant expect in the end sstablesplit should only be done offline
1328,is there any reason to not make the operation in part of the logic other than that it looks good to be the checks ensure that the unix untars will be the existing shell commands and not break anything
1329,applied thanks
1330,the current patch looks good
1331,patch looks good to me aside from the lack of unit tests
1332,sure you are right here i didnt make myself clear enough im sorry as you and rfc959 say when we are sending the file we should transform to nvtascii but not when we are receiving the file in this second case i think that the expected behaviour is that the text message be written to a file with the default line separator for the platform the sender converts the data from an internal character representation to the standard nvtascii representation see the telnet specification the receiver will convert the data from the standard form to his own internal form actually according to the spec before a retr ascii operation is transformed we should be converting the charset to ascii for our machine could be using ebcdic to store files and clients are supposed to expect that files are encoded in nvtascii so i dont know any way this has little priority for me until someone using a nonasciicompatible encoding complains so we could leave this for the future any way i dont like ascii mode for it breaks the rest command my implementation only supports binary mode
1333,leo the patch has been applied at revision r479576 thanks a lot for this enhancement please verify that the problem is fully fixed as you expected
1334,changed the workflow scheme should work now
1335,just committed this thanks sameer
1336,just committed this to trunk and branch2 thanks a lot for the chris and todd
1337,just gotten a chance to look at this a few things jump out immediately i have to chew over the changes to cayenne core a bit more off hand they dont seem bad but something feels weird about it while i can appreciate the cut working like a remove its a bit weird to be prompted to delete the item i cant paste an objentity i just cut back to the same datamap with the lack of an undo feature the only reasonable thing for me to do is a revert the datamap i think my font changed for labels ill have to verify that looking at again actually i cant seem to paste at all i even tried creating a new datamap and was unable to paste the objentity to that
1338,attached patch combined with an rm should be enough to call this a done deal
1339,im wrong about
1340,just committed this thanks espen andrzej and owen
1341,great thanks
1342,it out in isnt enough setting it to error works though
1343,its like thrift is going out of their way to make life suck for us this month
1344,advice this works
1345,you run yum repolist all and post what you see
1346,not use getsystemloadavg to make it portable
1347,to and trunk thanks for the patch anoop thanks for the review stack
1348,being said im not totally opposed to making the limit configurable
1349,ilya aleksei the patch was applied to bti branch at r542776 please check that the patch was applied as you expected
1350,thats kinda funny that you wrote the linkedto article it was a random google search
1351,im sorry i was unclear
1352,with grant license
1353,for taking a look jiannan
1354,
1355,radim i put this into trunk branch2 and branch0.23
1356,yea well need java for the future stuff wasnt sure what the projects posture on that is not a problem documentation is key however i dont think this patch should be accepted asis EMO_POS there is a lot of duplicate code in my patch i did this because i didnt want to mess with the queryrunner code if everyone thought my idea was stupid however there are a number of methods in the asyncqueryrunner are improved from the queryrunner see dbutils79 i propose that we create a base or abstract class which both queryrunner and asyncqueryrunner extend thoughts
1357,at revs and thanks blas
1358,nutch with solr has been a very demanding request so it will be very useful when this makes into trunk i have spend some time reviewing the patch which i find quite elegant some improvements to the patch would be make nutchdocument implement versionedwritable instead of writable and delegate version checking to superclass refactor getdetails methods in hitdetailer to searcher it is not likely that a class would implement searcher but not hitdetailer use searcher delete hitdetailer and searchbean rename xxbean classes so that they do not include bean i think it is confusing to have bean objects that have nontrivial functionality refactor lucenesearchbean.version to rpcsearchbean remove unrelated changes from the changes in ngramprofile correct me if im wrong as far as i can see we do not need any metadata for solr backend and only need and vector options for lucene backend so i think we can simplify nutchdocument metadata we may implement class fieldmeta o.a.l.document.field.store store o.a.l.document.field.index index o.a.l.document.field.termvector tv indexingfilter.getfields class nutchdocument private fieldmeta or alternatively we may wish to keep add methods of nutchdocument compatible with o.a.l.document.document keeping the metadata uptodate as we add new fields using this info at lucenewriter but ignoring in solrwriter this will be slightly slower but the api will be much more intuitive
1359,was commited on may
1360,idea
1361,have been promoted to ossrh some minutes ago it will take roughly hours before they appear on central so this one is close to be fixed
1362,my bad
1363,based on comments from matt thank you
1364,my feeling is that if file.lastmodified now access_time_resolution is not necessary since the lastmodified value will already be truncated to the system resolution but i do not think it is harmful i chose to throw exception only if file.canwrite because i was trying to minimise the impact of the change its not clear to me whether setlastmodified might work when file.canwrite however it certainly must work because of gc if file.canwrite i would consider moving the canwrite test outside of the setlastmodified call similar to getrecordifstored it just wasnt necessary to fix the immediate problem well not swallowed exactly but caught and converted to failure return code e.g see blobindatastore.getsize in any case the javadoc for documents as a possible failure return code so it had to be tested i think if throws an exception that is already correctly handled thanks for the quick response
1365,aidan can you cast your eye over this again thanks
1366,more ids for initial access greid and brock
1367,got lots of votes on this issue seems like we should take some action here i will assign it and make sure it will be resolved rather sooner than later bq please add this feauture to get expectations right we are working on releasing soon and this one should not block it i will work towards here
1368,patches look good EMO_POS
1369,did an ubuntu aptget install and downloaded the following unwanted packages flumotion_0.6.11_amd64.deb foomaticfilters_4.0.40ubuntu1.1_amd64.deb
1370,of flume1475
1371,thats what this change did sorry for the noise
1372,is a pretty awful bug
1373,to nag
1374,for the wild goose chase
1375,erwan for youre effort EMO_POS
1376,tried something similar i removed the handlers and kept the readers but the performance was not visible
1377,junit testcase so i dont loose it
1378,in advance jens
1379,manjula i think your approach basically looks good please see my comments below i think this code networkservercontrol servercontrol null int port string hostname servercontrol new initialized for the shutdown could be replaced by a call to networkservertestsetup.getnetworkservercontrol try servercontrol.shutdown catch exception e exception e.getmessage e.printstacktrace e.printstacktrace wont ever be called since its placed right after a call to fail anyway i think it is better just to remove the and let junit handle the exception itself i cant see that getnewport is used so its probably best to remove it it looks like most of the changes in testconfiguration.java are changes if you could post a new patch which only contained whats actually changed it would be easier to review those changes
1380,tests and committed to trunk thanks charles
1381,again for this really great patch andrew
1382,andrew the patch was applied to sql module at r525019
1383,you jacques for the quick commite pierre
1384,the batch file updates to revision thanks again
1385,diags.log is bad mojo since its never rotated
1386,pending announcement now
1387,
1388,i am sorry for the delay in responding if you think the new patch is read for commit can you check patch available and it will get back on the radar is derbyall clean as well l i am not seeing the original path anymore for future reference i think it is good in general to keep the old ones there to see whats changed thank you so much for all your work on derby
1389,patch committing
1390,and when xerces moves to sax this patch will satisfy the behaviour of sax1 and sax2
1391,that i think i missed some discussion in the mailing list
1392,be happy to edit the wiki when i get this resolved
1393,applied thank you
1394,chris could you add my username as initial developers for the spark jira thanks
1395,almost forgot as i received the email notification on the weekend
1396,work
1397,second thought i removed the patch this would just be working around the problem i could live with a verdict that this dev environment is broken in some way that im just not seeing or there is another option that avoids what looks like an enumeration over local addresses for reverse lookups including virbr networks since this is all localhost testing mocking the resolver is not unreasonable
1398,missed this
1399,is in thanks jarcec
1400,awesome work nick and thanks for the clarification bill
1401,was actually trying to debug the issue and didnt see anything that looked like it would nuke the under the datadomain and was wondering if it was a visual issue but didnt try saving the model to see if it had actually deleted it something about all that information disappearing was unsettling this is definitely a post thing i think thanks
1402,to grant license
1403,to the java compiler bugs jing mentioned i have reverted the commit
1404,however very interested in this feature as it is essential to me
1405,sorry the error was only triggered on a clean build thanks for the catch eric can you please review the simple fix
1406,you for the source code but why dont you also attach a diff file you get by running svn diff it will help us figure out which part is changed exactly thanks in advance your idea sounds very good though d
1407,looks good to me
1408,a lot for fixing those issues alejandro i reran all the tests i ran last night and everything worked great additionally i tried out testpatch.sh which seemed to work flawlessly patch looks good to me
1409,someone should have a look at this i just ran it again and it is still failing
1410,i forgot
1411,cut at a patch for
1412,im sujan i need to send proposal for gsoc for great it turned out simpler than what i would have thought thanks andy sorry for the noise if the different segments are somewhat homogeneous then these stats should pretty much be very close anyway USER_MENTION im working on getting harmony working on hadoop at present were pretty close and have workarounds for most issues but the trick is to fix the issues in such a way that we can create a patch with a resolution that works for all the jres yes there are equivalent classes for both ibm java and harmony so we could do something whereby it identifies the jre and then loads the appropriate library but im looking to see if there is a more extensible approach USER_MENTION yes hadoop works just fine on ibm java ive submitted patches targeted for see hadoop6923 and hadoop6924 that makes hadoop work cross jre the com.sun.security.auth classes were introduced with hadoop
1413,heres a patch for the general case and it also adds a warning that you should set your similarity with similarity.setdefault especially if you omit norms is there no way to remove this stupid static default and deprecate can we not use the similarity from indexwriter for the case of normswriter
1414,thanks simon
1415,havent had any time to try reupgrading after having to back out but i will be sure to let you know how it works out as soon as i get the opportunity
1416,is pretty embarassing
1417,is tricky that way
1418,that you decided not to detect the error based on finding two similarlynamed operations
1419,tried patching the current svn version of tapestrycore but the patch did not work for me either though no failure messages just silently does nothing when trying to get a page this is a homebrewed version of the quickstart app directory structure is jboss is set to deploy the directory packing the jar in works but cant do reloading or hot deployment in this case which is very annoying it would be nice if i could get this to work EMO_POS used jboss
1420,latest patch looks pretty good to me two small nits once these are addressed generally in the hadoop codebase we put the USER_MENTION annotation right above the method declaration below the method comment USER_MENTION test tostring for typical volumeid equality classes in the class declaration of invalid_volume_id i recommend putting a blank line between the methods being declared there thanks a lot for improving the test coverage in this area of the code ivan and thanks a lot to andrew for your reviews of these patches
1421,patch against the latest trunk and add the comment suggested by bikas
1422,you
1423,mayank
1424,you install a node module globally it goes into where you dont have permissions to move shit into unless you sudo
1425,daryn
1426,herbert sorry we cannot do this the scope of the blemlist aiui is at the svn repo level and we run a single repo for all the asf projects however buildbot works at the perproject level short of perhaps rewriting all of our buildbot mechanisms from the svn master this is not doable sorry
1427,karl
1428,the test with a build an everything seems fine
1429,to fabrizio for the patch
1430,to branch20security and trunk thanks dave
1431,ivan as donald has reassigned this jira to you please help to review and commit these patches after i submit the patch for tranql localization thanks btw the first patch in the list had already been committed
1432,again
1433,i am sorry it didnt work outofthebox for you yes by all means if you have time later and still have issues then open a new ticket
1434,docid field to the index for enwikidocmaker
1435,was hung just now for hours in testhregion testhregion is unorthodox intentionally in that it doesnt use inherit from hbaseclustertestcase so it didnt pick up the changes made mhbc.patch hopefully its this anomaly that was responsible for the hang attaching a patch that has testhregion do like the rest of the hbase and hadoop dfs tests shutting down the filesystem first and then the dfs cluster
1436,i dont want to specify the encoding because i dont care how the data is transported to me
1437,verified at r535584 thank you for applying it
1438,i will quit committing to hama then because im not going to support only a binary format
1439,jacques hi ankit i think i found the reason why we cant call layer recursivly i made a patch but i cant sync my trunk today im at our friends house and they have only internet via gps connection its so slow d i will provide the patch on monday morning have a good weekend sascha
1440,ok
1441,
1442,robert committed to trunk
1443,revision
1444,is awesome works in a oneliner
1445,looks good all tests pass
1446,havent had a chance to look at it yet
1447,always get the same stupid error
1448,patch looks good this cleans up a lot of code
1449,steve
1450,patch against new from cassandra4164
1451,pending jenkins
1452,cause is that the call to specificresponder.writeerror in responder.respond ultimately calls genericdata.resolveunion which in turn calls genericdata.getschemaname before the line where the unresolvedunionexception gets thrown
1453,sorry didnt create a patch for the readme since it was a small change it is included in this patch with the comment revision
1454,a lot jon for signing up this
1455,patch for this thanks a lot
1456,just committed this thanks samuel
1457,just committed this thanks jothi
1458,just committed this thanks flavio
1459,issue oozie is released
1460,r1146903 thanks jonas for the patch
1461,scott i have committed your last work in svn with rev
1462,applying mathias patch the sample documents works fine thanks mathias
1463,the patch thanks dennis
1464,wrong everything is cool
1465,user disregard
1466,to trunk thanks for the patch doug
1467,just committed this to trunk and branch0.23 thanks jason
1468,oliver thanks for catching this problem and for your suggested fix we can go one step in simplifying the fix by removing the need for uri altogether if we use the getresourceasstream method of classloader rather than getresource modified version of your fix committed in revision please could you check that this version of your fix works in your environment best regards george
1469,trying to conditionally hook this into the build so we can get it into svn and go from there
1470,owen
1471,we did it purposely because if the proxy services are dynamically loaded then we need to build those services at the runtime and redeploy them which is a little bit risky on a production environment also there is no mechanism to check whether a particular proxy definition is updated in the registry or not because this configuration is used only at the startup we can add this functionality to load the proxy services only at the startup time from the registry this doesnt mean they are dynamic but i dont see any value there if you could explain a bit about your exact requirement i might be able to provide an alternative to this thanks ruwan
1472,added your tests and didnt see any failures against activemq however i did make a change anyway to stompframe similar to you patch expect that i just used the datainputstreams readfully method to ensure all the data gets pulled off the wire
1473,i assumed modules doesnt need to be selfcontained like lucene or solr i can fix that by enforcing tools compilation in that macro ill do that bq steve will you double check again if everything works yes everything works for me now thanks bq and commit this in is there some reason why you cant do this imo committers should commit their own work bq i didnt put an entry into changes so youd have to add it if it qualifies at all to be mentioned there imo this definitely warrants a changes.txt entry this should also be backported to branch_3x bq this reminds me of the infrastructure tools problem we had in carrot2 we finally decided to simply have them as a standalone project living within the same repository space with a stored versioned binary artefact updated when tools had to be updated rarely this does version a binary file but you dont need to worry about recompiling things over and over to do this for this and any other ant tasks
1474,i was trying to get to the wiki but its been a busy week
1475,ankit your patch is in trunk at r1060220 i did not backport as its not breaking anything
1476,ashwin
1477,soon as i made the change in karaf i will submit the cxf patch
1478,for the clarification i will reintroduce separate data structure for notifications
1479,to trunk and thanks for the patch shaneal
1480,should ask first
1481,it to major as the case seems to be random please comment if you disagree
1482,have committed this thanks junping
1483,mapreduceplancompiler.java if instanceof reversibleloadstorefunc pomapreduce pom new execengine.getphysicaloptable logicalkey pigcontext pom.mapparallelism materializedresult.parallelismrequest return pom.getoperatorkey that looks to me like it wont allow map reduce to start unless the store func is reversible am i missing something
1484,have committed this thanks michele
1485,fine with my minimal test case and the tutorial thank you
1486,ping EMO_POS
1487,todd glad to be on board
1488,this issue and richard will add more information into the jira
1489,ill commit shortly thanks yonik
1490,a lot kiran for the patch
1491,a minor comment i dont see why the close method would throw an ioexception thanks asankha
1492,believe this is fixed by hadoop9984 lets wait for that patch to land and then triage
1493,didnt know we needed to retain backwards config capability across to EMO_NEG that sucks and itll make old code stick around longer
1494,committed thanks suresh
1495,epl licence please have a look at URL seems fine with some light constraints
1496,this patch back up to trunk level
1497,for doublechecking the fix knut i am thinking of merging the fix into tomorrow just to make sure that tests run fine on the tinderbox all the tests ran fine on my machine
1498,tom
1499,but i renamed a set of sstable files in to the wrong version and it did not catch this at startup im not sure what you mean which is the wrong version the legacy version does it still ignore tmp files at startup ill double check but i assume so i didnt change the check that removes tmp files because it did it based on looking for tempfile_marker anywhere in the file name which should continue to work
1500,has started if you want to submit a patch that would be great thanks
1501,is a nasty bug that ive seen in real life though
1502,believe this is a duplicate of httpcore328 oleg
1503,a few days ago
1504,revised dateconverter to conform to java changed isalphabetic to isdigit and reversed the values use as tilman suggested also fixed some javadoc in both dateconverter and testdateutil
1505,looks good to me colm
1506,just committed this thanks omer
1507,sorry guys
1508,to branch at revision
1509,feedback on the updated patch im guessing it wont cleanly apply to trunk anymore since its been two weeks but if the general idea looks correct i can update it to apply cleanly to the current trunk
1510,the patch into trunk with thanks to luca after minor refactoring
1511,daniel we will get back on this as soon as we have the correct information thank you
1512,indicates the standard inetorgperson schema under the standard this also shows the schema which is the custom schema
1513,is bad
1514,i committed this thanks kay kay
1515,you tweaked a couple little things with the standard cache capture state actually i think i just moved things around eg i made it the standardtermsdictreaders job to seek the termsin file i moved doccount up and i made a single cache entry i think i also removed a few attrs that we didnt need to store and downgraded skipoffset from long int its int on trunk
1516,looks good to me thanks hyunsik
1517,timestamps automagically would be bad because it would limit a whole swath of use cases
1518,the patch looks good
1519,even if it wasnt it would be totally worthless where it is at
1520,jacoo i finally commited it in revision thanks
1521,see no gain to make it singleton scala object too no need to change it without reason
1522,course strfieldsource is a private class no its not
1523,mutatelevel problem looks like what i predicted windows wont let you rename over an existing file
1524,that was my bad
1525,man its a fucking precendence problem
1526,sorry will submit them tomorrow hmm svn diff is really strange dont know why the files were not included though i did the diff from the dir
1527,ignore attachment
1528,andrew committed in rev
1529,work this is a great first cut
1530,work thank you
1531,to let you lose a wild goose chase
1532,this is an automatically generated email to reply visit URL looks good does it overwhelm the status display in the ui lars on andrew purtell wrote bq bq bq this is an automatically generated email to reply visit bq URL bq bq bq updated bq bq bq review request for hbase and michael stack bq bq bq summary bq bq bq consider exposing master event handler state as monitored tasks bq bq bq this addresses bug hbase5132 bq URL bq bq bq diffs bq bq bq bq bq bq f171a5a bq bq bq bq bq diff URL bq bq bq testing bq bq bq none yet bq bq bq thanks bq bq andrew bq bq
1533,you would like to take up this work thatd be great
1534,for spotting this fixed at r487519
1535,an attachment patch to add percentagedimensions and jpep quality handling against trunk
1536,fast thanks
1537,i did a skeleton of the code to use hashmap do you want to start from there and add what is missing
1538,do you know that a key will exceed a threshold until after youve passed it
1539,patch tests look good to me
1540,to branch2 and trunk thanks ahmed
1541,new patch incorporates a few of hairongs comments there is no need to check because logs are typically at info level anyway change the comment in addstoredblock on why we log when safemode is off
1542,propose to commit drop_column_v8_restored_tests.diff if there are any reviewers currently examining this patch please let me know unless any additional review comments are raised in the next hours i will commit the patch
1543,a lot for the review todd ive just committed this to the hdfs3077 branch
1544,great thanks junping then i will first commit hadoop8820.b1.002.patch for the additional bug fixes lets create a new jira since we also need to fix the code in trunk
1545,dropped check for references we need to always compact if references
1546,async api in http client really sucks
1547,i hated that aspect of working for commercial companies
1548,job ill review this patch todays night
1549,
1550,thats all good news too thanks guys one less on my radar
1551,we cant let fear of backcompat prevent us from making progress
1552,have a really bad habit of not reading thru all the bug comments before asking questions
1553,patch effectively reverts the hive4688 change the npe is fixed in vectorizedrowbatch by hive4758
1554,actually dih started as a standalone webapp inside aol we changed it because we didnt want to duplicate the schema in two places and also because we wanted to have it available by default in solr installations another web app means you need to procure hardware plan create firewall holes etc even if it were a standalone app i would still run it on the same hardware that runs solr though i might run it on the secondary servers that arent normally seeing query load why would you need to have the schema in two places my dih config doesnt mention any field names because all solr field names match the mysql field names even if they didnt im not sure why it would be any different than any other solrj client which doesnt need to have a copy of the schema bq talking to multiple collections was never a goal for dih im not sure what value it will bring ive got a sharded index currently production is on version full rebuilds are done with dih because my solrj application cant touch it for indexing speed it does fine for keeping the index up to date with onceaminute updates but for indexing millions of documents per shard dih beats it handily even though its only singlethreaded if i could put all the dih stuff into one central place it might make it easier to manage i do intend to look at the dih code to see how it manages to run so fast so i can hopefully improve my own code but i can never find the time
1555,it is my fault please defer this patch ill raise jira for other as its dependance soon sorry for inconvenience
1556,just thought of one more thing we should do we should make the stringinterner as USER_MENTION and USER_MENTION the api is simple enough i dont see much of a problem locking it down
1557,to be a faulty mailserver setup at lagunaindustries.com
1558,revision
1559,that was weird
1560,check for hadoop native lib is wrong
1561,guillaume i think that what you are saying is right and i find despite is on the specification or not that to have the error status is quite useful but i dont agree that if inonly mep terminate with an error status it should propagated back i agree totally with gianfranco this should be done only when were working in sync mode otherwise its better not to propagate the error back and use feature like restart from the failure point that weve just implemeted do you agree with this andrea
1562,luis
1563,kathey
1564,also solr2399 this has done some great work revamping the admin ui
1565,looks reasonable to me sucks we have to special case handling of
1566,laura
1567,patch sorry
1568,just committed this thanks amareshwari
1569,the past i have enjoyed working with everyone here
1570,revision
1571,this is solrs fault by having a getter that does some heavy duty xml shit
1572,the name of jira from multithreaded to parallel as weve done it with forks instead of threads
1573,i had attached an older version lets try this one
1574,patch wouldnt compile
1575,a lot for your excellent work shazron
1576,comment
1577,dont know how the hell my diff program decided to add seemingly random cr chars but ive removed them now
1578,thanks aaron
1579,an attachment patch for build.xml to add for jar tasks
1580,aidan can you review this change please thanks
1581,agree thats a good idea
1582,joe
1583,to trunk thanks for the patch rajesh thanks for the review ram
1584,for your review ive just committed
1585,looks good checking this in
1586,just committed this patch thanks richard
1587,still be stuck in the loop though if cant actually close regions
1588,to trunk thanks navis i will recommend inclusion of this bug fix in as well
1589,patch just removes the lines of code that send the second newleader quorum packet the first packet is sent with leaderlastzxid updates a few lines above
1590,an attachment repro
1591,for the noise
1592,to trunk thanks bharath and thanks cos for helping review
1593,looks like we have to rebuild stackmaptable from scratch during method generation ive tried bcel code and it looks like it already have implementation we need but i dont see ways to reuse it for now by the way i recommend to increase this issue priority to high or blocker
1594,sorry certainly right
1595,pi i do not think there is any special tricks besides those with linux such as you will need ant junit java svn etc if you want you can also send me your pig.jar and then i will try it out for you best regards xu
1596,thanks chris
1597,a look at current svn head i have changed the styling stuff of the component with this approach it should work now just specify the style attribute and give it a width value i also have had a look at how we can influence the default dojo styling stuff and have updated the wiki on this URL can you test it if it works for you
1598,indeed odd i didnt knowingly reformat must have been a mishap
1599,cool this is just a matter of adding strings to the various URL returns in files.cpp there are a number of error cases in the URL and URL endpoints id imagine one could change the javascript to generate bad requests which should be sufficient to test this EMO_POS
1600,looks good
1601,thanks for the review avery
1602,an attachment modified sqltransformer in full
1603,are going to kill me when i say this but it seems like we should just commit your first patch
1604,bad patch
1605,glad i was able to help
1606,as open since looks like it needs some more work
1607,thanks closing the issue then
1608,be naming this camelrss rather than camelrome in case we change to some other rss lib in the future
1609,bryan
1610,can you review it thanks
1611,i believe someone has already addressed it in camel4294 i have linked the issue here
1612,for letting you guys wait
1613,to sameer since apparently he cant assign to himself
1614,chris thanks for your detailed response thanks
1615,lets just do this in
1616,crap that worked
1617,revision
1618,adds mayberefreshblocking which blocks on refreshlock it also renames reopenlock to refreshlock shares the refresh logic between mayberefresh and mayberefreshblocking switches to use reentrantlock instead of EMO_NEG it allows to protectively obtain the lock in domayberefresh see comment in the code it is better in general because its equivalent to yet protects against an accidental bug where someone changes to ill add a changes entry after the patch is reviewed and we agree on the approach
1619,have committed this thanks cw
1620,revision
1621,looks good thanks mayank
1622,thanks a lot
1623,looks good to me trying it out
1624,are right i missed that point i am oleg
1625,hmm infostream is just for debugging should we really make it volatile ill remove its volatile bq iwc cannot be made immutable you build it up incrementally new iwc setthis setthat its fields cannot be final setters can return modified immutable copy of this so you get both incremental building and immutability oh yeah but then wed clone the full iwc on every set this seems like overkill in the name of purity what about earlier compromise mentioned by shay mark me keep setters for live properties on iw this clearly draws the line and you dont have to consult javadocs for each and every setting to know if you can change it live or not i really dont like that this approach would split iw configuration into two places like you look at the javadocs for iwc and think that you cannot change the ram buffer size iwc should be the one place you go to see which settings you can change about the iw that some of these settings take effect live while others do not is really an orthogonal and i think secondary ie handled fine jdocs
1626,what reminded me of ubjson actually i looked at ubf and it looks rather complicated for a data exchange i wouldnt say no but i dont have any interest in supporting it ubjson shouldnt be anything more than writing a parser which should be and then adding the logic to switch based on content and accept types i have no idea what ubf really even is under the hood but it sounded a lot more complicated
1627,for the patch niall
1628,just remembered one of the reasons why i didnt do this the last time i looked at it i dont think functionquery has any good unit tests in the solr code base there might be some tests that use the solrtestharness to trigger function queries but they arent really portable
1629,looks good ill commit once hcatalog239 is in
1630,no longer working on this
1631,talat no this patch is for the branch_2x branch only
1632,i cant apply on top of either my trunk from feb or current trunk rebased and eclipse generates the diff in a different order from git commandline so i cant tell whats changed by eyeballing the diff either ive attached rebasedtocurrenttrunk versions of my can you attach your fixes as a on top of those
1633,the patch looks good
1634,jochen its not about building successfully which i have no issue with that as well its about resolving the right dependencies of the dependency use mvn to see if you really have them all correctly if you are getting them right too mvn yeap apparently i uploaded the pom after testing it against not yc
1635,to trunk thanks for patch tudor and review michael
1636,dont have resources to hand to test this at mo
1637,git i love git EMO_POS
1638,tested them out and everything is fine
1639,rahul i will take a look at it this evening aaron
1640,myrna
1641,henri and don i found there are two commonvalidator.jar in my jboss application server env one in and the other in the lib directory of my web application then i delete the latter and it works well thank you so much
1642,pleasure
1643,you please port it to branch1 that that we could integrate it to branch1win slavik thanks for the review
1644,an attachment catalogfactorybase
1645,are right its the wrong one an older attempt
1646,for reviewing suresh committed to trunk
1647,david reiss writes as i recall jonathan was the only person who really seemed to care about this issue and he wasnt satisfied with my suggestion so i put it aside chad also requested some changes to my diff for the json protocol ill try to reevaluate the status some time soon but i am away from a computer today jonathan are you still in the loop on this one what do you think given the fundamental differences in what a string is across different languages theres unlikely to be a clean solution that suits everyone having a backwardscompatible compromise that works is much better than having nothing though
1648,is not a major issue
1649,sandy
1650,willem yes youre right i did not realized that i had a explicit dependency on the wrong version you can close this ticket
1651,fine thank you george
1652,please close this issue as it is not reproducing any more thanks
1653,committed this to trunk and branch thanks rakesh
1654,we on the good path

1661,stuff stephen
1662,anders thanks for the review and the good advice the attached patch rmtestpreparedstatementmethods_v2.diff should address your comments
1663,guys EMO_NEG i was the reason for this trouble
1664,for the patch URL
1665,dawid bq yes this is pretty much the topn nodes reordering that i did albeit without any optimization of how many n to take the hardcoded magic constants should probably be justified somehow or replaced by a default in fst somewhere bq deciding how many nodes to reorder is i think hard i failed to provide any sensible fast heuristic for that and i simply do a simulated annealing to find a local optimum yeah the algo is simplistic now and it does force caller to pick the params though and are probably pretty good we can and should make it more sophisticated over time we have at least one spare bit to still use in the arc flags EMO_POS bq one thing i was wondering is why you decided to integrate the packer with the fst wouldnt it be cleaner to separate packing from construction granted this requires a double pass over the fst nodes and more intermediate memory but it wouldnt add any more complexity to the builder which is already ehm a bit complex you can compare this design in morfologik well its tricky first i decided to change node targets to ords so that pack could use an array to relatively efficiently hold node data eg incount newaddress etc that required making the first pass fst modal derefd or not if we didnt do this then the packer would have to use even less ram efficient data structures eg i think second the format written by the packer is tightly coupled with the fst reading ie there are sizable differences when reading packed vs unpacked fst but i agree itd be cleaner if we could move packing out eg util.pack and more strongly decouple packing from fst format one thing id really like to somehow do is create different classes for fst writing vs reading and different classes for each format we now have writeord writenonord readpacked readunpacked and even the two readers have different modes depending on input_type
1666,sounds like a plan i love peerreviews EMO_POS
1667,in revision
1668,URL is related but not same
1669,patch for review christian could you see if this works for you thanks
1670,looks good but a bunch of tests are now broken because of the new hidden input i will fix the tests do some more testing and commit in the next few days thanks for the patch
1671,as thanks for ivans improvement thanks flavio for reviewing
1672,responder seemed to be a bottleneck
1673,are messing down deep below hbase in dfs
1674,idea about the issue its still active but im afraid that by no stretch of the imagination can it be termed a critical issue
1675,i just made some more long running tests and found some problems in the patch i submitted the mechanism is working but it shrinks the caches too quickly and it prints too much log output log.info instead of log.debug i will fix those problems and submit a new patch sorry thomas
1676,about the report
1677,andreas i will check it
1678,patch committed revision thanks john
1679,is fine
1680,in existing testdelegationtokenrestoredonrmrestart
1681,moving this to as i really cant stand to release with this if this becomes too long we can move it again to
1682,had a bad comparator in the testcli config
1683,pretty cool fresh and minimalist love it EMO_POS good work
1684,i doing something stupid here
1685,patch looks good to me
1686,you
1687,henry and pat well have to re submit all the pas so trigger hudson
1688,just committed this thanks
1689,for your work on this allen
1690,that was some bad work
1691,good to me mike
1692,
1693,for the new patch kristian the changes look good to me to commit a tiny nit in statementpoolingtest the code below could be expressed with an assertequals now that theres only one condition if if class name expectedname or expectedname got simplename class name expectedname got simplename
1694,didnt have time to work on this yet
1695,thanks jiayan
1696,you know of a way please describe it
1697,patch looks good just applied on the branch and trunk thanks a lot keep them coming EMO_POS
1698,optimized caching in kernelnodestore a bit in revision the test now just runs for a very long time with xmx128m and didnt run out of memory so far on my machine though it is still working on child nodes after it reported nodes in ms
1699,i use jdk and not EMO_POS
1700,is a bug in payloadnearquery if there are multiple top level spans that match the query only the payloads of the first one are retrieved this patch fixes this bug by iterating over all the top level spans to get the payloads see setfreqcurrentdoc the base explain method cant be abstract something like ah right this is included in the patch changes dont seem thread safe any more since there are now member variables it may still be all right but have you looked at this aspect i guess that could be said about payloadtermspanscorer and payloadnearspanscorer too payloadscore payloadsseen as for the payloadfunction classes they seem lightweight enough to be created with each query is there a better pattern peter
1701,i made a simple test on small linkdb and i didnt see any improvment youre right there is no need to add it
1702,suresh
1703,that sucks
1704,per every bad disk
1705,am new to mina and the whole environment
1706,my bad i was mistaken
1707,guys ive been pretty busy work but i have been watching this
1708,on earth is it buggy
1709,all resolved tickets from or older
1710,as a duplicate of derby3061 which is fixed in derby
1711,tommaso bq however i think it should be good if it was possible to alternatively get rid of the uimaconfig file defining each parameter inside the processor with solr elements etc as well ive done this in the attached patch please review it im not confident about the part the structure is appropriate or not
1712,is an idiot and we need gmake
1713,image showing blip padding in the google wave client
1714,whole thing is very distressing to me
1715,applied thanks
1716,sorry just fixed
1717,is something that some people have asked for since my cnet days i thought there was already an open issue for this but i cant seem to find it so i guess not
1718,suresh
1719,about these sorry
1720,review by eod today thanks for the tip
1721,are messing down deep below hbase in dfs
1722,to trunk and branch22 thanks ari
1723,is ok thanks stepan
1724,rick
1725,awesome job sergey
1726,is default for staging in hadoop root of the staging area for users job files in practice this should be the directory where users home directories are located usually
1727,shengtao you would think if you follow check if the service is there add if it is not then add a bindingtemplate then you would not be overwriting a bindingtemplates you are right though if you are saving a service it will overwrite the existing one and it will remove any bindingtemplates if they are there the current behavior is how the uddi v3 spec tells us to so it but we could add a config option to differentiate from the spec please let me know if you are following the above strategy and seeing issues kurt
1728,jing
1729,like a good idea
1730,find the attached screenshot for reference
1731,an attachment patch to validatorrules.xml for bug
1732,could you please explain detail
1733,are evil
1734,is a java problem
1735,looks mostly good to me one comment i think the name moveanddeletelocalfiles isnt quite descriptive enough perhaps asyncdeletepathoneachvolume or something the fact that the path is relative to volumes and will be deleted on each of them is the key part i didnt understand at the first pass through the jira i agree with vinod that it would be nice to share code with cleanupqueue but would be fine seeing it in another jira
1736,i also changed a test to test a nonascii stopword EMO_POS
1737,some reason i couldnt upload the straight patch
1738,thanks a lot for applying the patch the changes are on the site everything looks the way it should imho we should close the issue now p.s forgot to mention other changes sorry will be more attentive in future
1739,i just committed this to branch thank you benoy
1740,patch looks good now and the tests are all running fine now lets wait for hudson
1741,you please try the patch thanks very much
1742,here is a patch that works i was stupid enough not to see it
1743,to add that i also tried this with and without hbase5864
1744,thanks for your help
1745,over to you EMO_POS
1746,glad we were able to resolve this issue
1747,to trunk revision thanks bob
1748,the patch is badly named sorry
1749,the patch to trunk thanks sameera
1750,
1751,ok
1752,great to see youve gotten the ball rolling chris
1753,have committed this thanks rodrigo
1754,lost the whole morning cause hbases regionserver was dying with no logs no nothing how am i supposed to debug the issue if u do not even generate a core dump
1755,typo our part in place of one part above
1756,i dont interpret it that way i dont think our indexinputs should be doing writes
1757,release of the framework
1758,tom let me see if i can come up with a test case for the linereader reset i did forget adding a test case for that i probably file that as part of this patch
1759,tested a couple of projects with idea and and some more with idea and everything is working
1760,group including qa agrees this is not something for
1761,i have not been able to get the time to run the other tests however i did try changing the timeoutwait i set it to as suggested the test failed as it did before i then decided to change it to an unrealistic number the program died as it did before whats interesting with this test is that it did not even run for a minute as such i dont think changing this value had any impact on the problem
1762,problems i was talking about are mostly fixed by and
1763,just committed this to trunk and branch as they are test cases and no change to functionality thanks vinod
1764,erwan if you dont mind i have reassigned to you as you assigned yourself the umbrella task
1765,looks good to me too
1766,daryn i put this into trunk and branch2
1767,patch adds rule for hm and rs to the coresite template
1768,bash on linux not working bash on solaris csh on solaris ksh on aix bash on aix so youre right i close this bug as work as designed sorry for the noise EMO_POS
1769,a fix
1770,EMO_POS
1771,how stupid of mine to have a system.out again
1772,very cool
1773,ronald the fix i put in on the caused pages to stop drawing in the rc1 i have reverted part of the fix for this bug to get resolved could you please take a look at the comments for and test out the head of the branch to make sure that this version works for your case
1774,weird to me could you package a totally
1775,i briefly looked at the patch it looks like you are trying to get rid of the journal spool in bn correct me if i am wrong i dont think you can bn makes a checkpoint from its memory state which differs it from snn and cn while it does it the namespace should be locked for modifications so the edits go into journal spool which is reapplied to memory after the checkpoint is finished please see the design doc in hadoop4539
1776,anton fix applied to accessibility module at repo revision r598652 please check it is fixed as you expected
1777,default the auth prompt is suppressed making this a rare issue closing
1778,you ravi
1779,think my first preference would be to make this only a java and up feature the change is very clear and we can use our normal testing methods meanwhile users can set their umask appropriately my second preference would be only to only change permissions by default with java and higher i think we really need to have tests for the default configuration and nonportable tests might have to be customized to different environments which seems like a lot of effort for something that wont be used moving forward i am sorry i didnt chime in earlier time has been quite tight recently
1780,chandan khandelwal
1781,is useful advice call me biased if youd like
1782,for providing the patch
1783,curious how did you solve the split packages issues and invalid symbolic names with some lucene modules i cant see it in the parent pom
1784,i did hit the error while i did that but i will verify again ugh if thats the case then maybe catch the oom in the read and fallback to the temp buffer read solution
1785,for the review andrew
1786,all resolved tickets from or older
1787,this was on sorry i should have mentioned that before thats great to know thanks
1788,to trunk thanks gunther
1789,example
1790,thanks i also ran with mvn clean install and it looks good
1791,can you rebase this patch thanks
1792,fact if you happen to know why observerhammerquorumtest is failing with this latest patch id love to hear
1793,was attached to the wrong bug
1794,applied to thank you
1795,zheng
1796,really dont know how to solve this problem
1797,about the trouble
1798,bad
1799,we should not invoke the global synced fieldnumbers shit for every element only when the setting actually changes
1800,
1801,tim patch was applied as expected
1802,now sets publishentry to true
1803,thanks stephen
1804,code has been checked in thanks to gordon for that
1805,thanks for the suggestion URL
1806,of infra4886
1807,digy i like to know a bit more about this patch what test case is it fixing how did you determine the race condition the changes to the threadclass is considerable and im trying to understand why this wasnt a problem in earlier versions thanks george
1808,to fit changes from flume1005
1809,think what happens is all bugs are initially internal to oracle and they need to be opened up to the public i presume this is so that critical bug reports dont immediately become available for exploits but im just guessing
1810,both idea and idea seem to handle them just fine
1811,current version the same error cause different messages because there are many commiters
1812,misunderstood the response stopfilter indeed did not change
1813,jeff
1814,yes perhaps i got a bit trigger happy although i did get a from another committer and i assumed that the submit patch to hudson wouldnt be able to pick up on the renaming of the test using patch.sh and would fail perhaps there is a better way to do this which i am not aware of glad to get feedback though need to properly get the hang of the process
1815,revision to trunk i will now backport to
1816,logged a new ticket hadoop9280 as this is critical problem for people trying to upgrade from to
1817,had almost the same interface for the commandline option in mind but sticking to the previous formats for specifying the id url URL operation getworkflowinstmet id and in return display the values in the format as you suggested above
1818,im committing wraps a very long line else what matteo suppied
1819,works fine now
1820,on earth does createlink need a request
1821,actually depends on hdfs3863 so not committing until that one is in
1822,thanks too be honest i havent looked at noop much it was just used in the original patch ilook at your updated patch and see what more work needs to be done
1823,mayank
1824,just committed this thanks tom
1825,disagree and i guess im willing to go to bat for this
1826,for my poor review didnt notice EMO_NEG
1827,by andrew
1828,optimization in trunk revision
1829,im continuing along the path chris started with his first patch mine is coming soon nikola
1830,to be failing for a different reason now time elapsed sec failure
1831,anybody now if this is fixed in a later release
1832,changed my mind and resolved dirmina82 and therefore we dont need to fix this issue anymore
1833,just committed this thanks patrick
1834,the latest patch looks good to me
1835,path as zookeeper794_4.patch.txt but strip the path prefix added by git
1836,attached
1837,appears in mswindows environment too the following monkeypatch resolves the problem div.datepicker td toplabel color windowtext patch datepicker.css sorry still dont know how to official patches datepicker td toplabel color captiontext color windowtext display block fontweight bold important width textdecoration none
1838,r1185532 thanks flavio
1839,chuck is scary
1840,kinda like the black acctually but that may largely be due to my prefering the fire solr logo over the futuristic magnifying glass the contrasts nicely with the to my mind the solr sun connection has allways been really cool
1841,suresh i think this task is also related to amber63 since both oauth and open id connect use json web token jwt
1842,patch is for thanks
1843,am not really sure what does the receive payment do before the shipment it doesnt sound as if it is doing what we expect it to do
1844,for the noise
1845,in svn will let vincenzo close it if he is satisfied
1846,in mind this is to support development scenarios only if a project in an ide references jars in lets say a maven repo we need the ability to add individual entries to the shard lib without having to copy each individual jar over to the shared library so the answer to your first question is no this is not the same there is no way to add invidivial entries i dont quite understand your second bullet third bullet true just thought it would be nice to have an empty template yes agree a test case should be added
1847,grumble
1848,the hell ill give this a shot
1849,checked this into trunk branch2 branch2.1.0alpha and branch0.23 thanks daryn for a quick fix to this
1850,thanks
1851,exactly sorry to be so unclear just really youd be interested in working on these id like to get them cleaned up because there are now so many that other more important meaningful warnings are likely to be ignored
1852,status from assigned to new for consistency
1853,on earth are you anyway
1854,good thanks laura
1855,hadoop7853 andy needs a little more time in deciding whether hadoop7853 is good enough replacement for
1856,can be extended with handlerdescription without pain only problem is a contribution to componenttypedescription by custom handlers simple slot for custom handlers to keep their information in displayable format would be sufficient
1857,that sucks
1858,for the delay
1859,thoughts i had about this overall i think its a good idea seems like its not crazy to add and would have multiple benefits logical striping across the l1 boundary is a simple solution to both proactively handle splits and reduce compaction times thoughts on this feature fixed configs in the same way that we got a lot of stability by limiting the to a fixed number we might want to similarly limit the number of stripes per region to or x instead of every y bytes this will help us understand the benefit we get from striping and its easy to double the striping and chart the difference namenode pressure obviously a striping factor will cause scaling of the fs can we offset this by increasing the hdfs block size since addblock dominates at scale really unlike hadoop you have all of the hfile or none of it missing a portion of the hfile currently invalidates the whole file you really need hdfs block hfile however we could probably just toy with increasing it by the striping factor right now and seeing if that balances things open times i think this will be an issue specifically on server start need to be careful here major compaction you can perform a major compaction remove deletes as long as you have contiguous i dont think youd need to involve l0 files in an mc at all save the complexity furthermore part of the reason why we created the tiered compaction is to prevent files from participating in mc because of cache thrashing poor minor compactions and a handful of other reasons so some thoughts on related pain points we seem to have that tie into this feature reduce cache thrashing region moves kill us a lot of time because we have a cold cache there is a worry that more aggressive compactions mean more thrashing i think it will actual even this out better since right now a mc causes a lot of churn just should be thinking about this if perf after the feature isnt what we desire unnecessary iops outside of this algorithm we should just completely get rid of the requirement to compact after a split we have the block cache so given a in the file we can easily tell our mid point for future splits theres little reason to aggressively churn in this way after splitting poor locality for grid topology setups we should eventually make the striping algorithm a little more intelligent about picking our replicas if all stripes go to the same secondary tertiary node then splits have a very restricted set of servers to chose for datanode locality
1860,looks good to me
1861,harsh good to know
1862,to trunk thanks sergey
1863,the status of this issue is it still alive the latest comments seem to indicate it was a dns misconfiguration problem stack could that have been the cause of your experience with the issue
1864,can confirm this is not happening on ubuntu with openjdk did anyone get a chance to look at this apparently macspecific issue
1865,have been changes to the method updatecurrentiterator between these versions that we need so we cant just reverse the change id love to fix any bug that can be identified cleanly for now though im placing this in needinfo awaiting a test case
1866,looks good to me as a first step tested with both config and schema errors would be nice if single core with the solr.xml also worked but no biggie we can fix with the rest of multicore bq note for no good reason what so ever well i think it was supposed to work even though the whole idea is kind of broken anway cause it attempted to so reason is prob a bug
1867,looks good to me reuploading patch with one corrected codecomment
1868,cannot reproduce this bug on my test machine can you produce it reliably maybe we should revert hbase3899 until the time we can fix it
1869,patch looks fine id include too on deps as per project.xml
1870,was in too much of a hurry sorry hold on a sec
1871,it over thanks mayank
1872,quite perfect after solving pdfbox490
1873,
1874,once again
1875,bob your patch is in trunk at r932317
1876,is built with java
1877,derby71610datatypescollationaa.diff at subversion revision
1878,the extractionrequesthandler go away
1879,are welcome
1880,output connector should also have a say in what urls it will accept
1881,really dont care
1882,it back in if you think different
1883,you thejas for the patch and ivan for the review
1884,in rev thanks will
1885,christian
1886,chance to get a patch also for this EMO_POS
1887,to rush a commit when an issue is under discussion
1888,stupid bug in a patch that is already applied
1889,for the patch michael van geertruy EMO_POS
1890,oops then i hadnt defined it i was assuming that it would be handled like the other special characters sorry for the trouble
1891,the fuck is asking for scores but not the max score and why does their insanely specialized use case justify all these booleans on a central lucene class
1892,thanks committed to cassandra2.0 as commit
1893,sorry i misunderstood you
1894,on this patch for trunk and after looking at latest version thanks for addressing the review and given you fellas are running it let me retry hadoopqa to see if the above fails are just sporadic
1895,for fixversion
1896,you jing
1897,bad we cant use in ie6
1898,yes this would be the way i would expect it to work but perhaps we can add ognl expression evaluation as well this could be usefull in other cases as stated in xw340 what do you think
1899,cant you use extendedfieldcache.getlongs passing in your own longparser
1900,of hadoop300
1901,patch to get submit for hudson again
1902,stepan
1903,fop_bug_pagenumbercitation.fo has been added with description fo to reproduce bug
1904,issue was ruled a flash player issue all the way back in by adobe it is not an apache flex bug so we cant fix it
1905,looks good to me
1906,sweet that you have the prior experience hacking this on top of a store already
1907,the following tag always adds i thought that staticjavascript purpose was to allow things like and create a jsp with something like page taglib and take profit of browsers cache no this is broken as a workaround can be used but this hasnt any benefint over generating both static and dynamic javascript in the same tag except form multiple forms per page if this is the intended behaviour im sorry for reopenning the bug
1908,didnt have any problems just testonly changes backported
1909,i figured it was better to get it in the public domain sooner and let the iterative process do its work
1910,edward thanks for spotting it
1911,to trunk thanks
1912,for all the issue mails i forgot to mention the second there is commented source in the test should it be enabled or removed
1913,btw i have only helped santosh malviya for ofbiz1468 where ever he needs and reviewed his work after that its only his effort to convert java to minilang testing the patch so majority of credit goes to santosh malviya EMO_POS
1914,bianco first of all could you add a apache licence to the file vectorhighlightmapper.cs your work is very good and pass all tests but it is not like just a simple bug fix and there is a divergence from fvh java this makes life hard while making new versions ports all lucene.net community any idea about what we should do digy
1915,addition to that datacontext.newobject shouldnt throw on classes that are not dataobjects
1916,typo above should have written these calls serve to find the correct active nn and then the following nonidempotent ones succeed
1917,for taking a look bikas and devaraj committing this
1918,bug is a duplicate of hive3253
1919,your patch is in trunk at r1061167 r10.04 at r1061173 r9.04 at r1061174
1920,for your patience
1921,like this title
1922,about that
1923,hari
1924,grabbed the wrong ticket
1925,thanks namit
1926,found the sad attempt at a script you asked about and uploaded it to mapreduce4282
1927,ivan
1928,on top of log4j and its abstract base class for supporting other frameworks
1929,karthik
1930,i kind of forget about this one
1931,for your patience
1932,this looks good to me
1933,josh im sorry i didnt check all the path that could effect the http method url after went through the code and i found a way to verify my change and find a minor issue of http component i will commit a better patch shortly willem
1934,thanks
1935,from phani and vamsi that need to be applied to activemq i verified the patches work with activemq and the latest geronimo code form late feb
1936,hoping im not teaching you how to suck eggs EMO_POS
1937,will be the sponsor for your beer the next time we meet
1938,bad
1939,for the trouble vikram
1940,created
1941,state stuck at allocated state it is a dup of
1942,
1943,yeah i was on that idiotpath for a good while but commonslang is a hairball at least where this hashcode making and equals is concerned
1944,good
1945,please also consider submitting a test case for this issue this will increase the chances of the patch getting committed sooner rather then later oleg
1946,my bad
1947,havent spent enough time thinking about this but i think it is more than just fixing the error message string it seems that the comparable method in dtd should return int rather than boolean and the return int value will decide if we should throw what we are throwing today ie something like error comparisons between varchar and char are not supported or throw a new message because collations dont match this is just my initial thought havent spend enough time to think about a solution
1948,patch solved this issue in a test case
1949,reopen if necessary
1950,neil thanks for the advice on the other hand if you can design a handler that knows how to make appropriate calls to the scanners sendchars method so that the buffer gets flushed when a maximum buffer size is reached then perhaps a pluggable handler wouldnt be necessary since the default behaviour would always work when an application has chosen to set this limit the code i have as written does have the pluggable handler notion since i didnt want to arbitrarily couple the xmlbuffer class implementation or worse its interface to the scanner i didnt go so overboard as to allow multiple registered handlers or anything like that this seemed simple enough without being a hack id also observe that xmlbuffer has to check to use the infelicitously named insurecapacity method to make sure its large enough yes this is where i implemented the fullhandler invocation its more or less as you describe once i get everything cleaned up ill post the patch here youll probably find it to be entirely unsurprising i think what ill end up doing to allow userconfigurable buffer size limit will be to add a setter method on parser and abstractdomparser something like setinputbuffersize i think that would be most consistent with the existing api sound ok
1951,looks like i didnt save all java files after massreplace of whitespace i will attach another patch nothing of significance will change
1952,too bad
1953,of axis2897
1954,very cool
1955,of course goes to dick
1956,thanks joel
1957,just committed this thanks jim
1958,sucks badly
1959,man it looks good we need a changes entry but from my side this looks good we can tackle the todos on trunk
1960,love this
1961,sorry didnt realise that set e took care of it for you i will have to go back and work out why its failing but not triggering my ci system as such you can close this
1962,fails for the same reason
1963,of the error is that hiddenactivations cannot be resolved
1964,vincent thanks very much for taking the time to look closely at my patch in reply to comment in reply to comment in reply to comment adrian thanks for doing this ive looked at the patch and have a few comments myself id suggest to rename strictconfiguration to validateconfiguration just a personal preference the configuration will still be validated regardless of the setting of this variable its just how the error is handled that makes the difference if strictconfiguration is true then fop will immediately throw an exception and processing will terminate if strictconfiguration is set to false then fop will log the error and attempt to continue parsing the configuration if the name of the variable strictfo in seems wrong theres nothing fo specific there furthermore some if strictfo should actually be if strictconfig right i think you may have been looking at an older patch the variable strictvalidation is as before and the new variable is called strictuserconfigvalidation no jeremias is right actually there are if strictfo statements to test if an exception has to be thrown that should be if validateuserconfigstrictly i should have better looked darn it i didnt think jeremias was refering to the configure method i missed this thanks also in the new code a hyphenationtreeresolver is no longer created and assigned to the hyphresolver field that should inevitably lead to a nullpointerexception later however the hyphenation junit tests pass strange are you sure of what youre doing thanks for checking this i made a mistake refactoring here EMO_NEG one other thing when getting the defaultpagesettings parameter its not necessary to test if pageconfig is null it will never be see the javadoc of getchild ive read the javadoc and have this unnecessary check now adrian would you please install the checkstyle plugin in your ide there are a few nits about the java style in your patch checkstyle will help you find them something checkstyle doesnt seem to be catching we usually dont put spaces inside brackets if test instead of if test yes i have noticed this recently and believe all the code ive added adheres to this now get well quickly adrian after a weekend in bed am feeling much better today thanks i had installed checksytle but not enabled it i will recreate the patch this morning hope you feel better now sorry ill ask you to create yet another patch but that should really be the last one its ok i am learning all the bumps for fop patch submissions hopefully should be smoother for you guys next time EMO_POS kind regards adrian
1965,fuck EMO_POS sorry not my day more beer needed
1966,it back in if you think different
1967,you need to grab the zipped version aka solr215.patch.zip since june i was trying to be space bandwidth friendly sorry i did not make it more obvious in some previous comments henri
1968,really appreciate your comments and i really enjoy our discussions EMO_POS
1969,thanks for pointing it out we did not take the latest patch by mistake and thought this change was missing sorry about that but still i think this jira we can use to solve org.apache.hadoop.hbase.mapreduce.testimportexport.testsimplecas
1970,it works fine thank you
1971,just committed this thank you lohit
1972,committed thanks pradeep
1973,if its windows and its a local filesystem uri do the osspecific subbing you cant always tell whether its a local filesystem uri lots of relative paths are constructed that do not contain a scheme
1974,you brandon
1975,it would be great
1976,i dont think it makes sense to argue about who the exception messages are for i think the opposite because it has an impact on the library design not that cm cannot go on with the current way but my point is that luc and you are focusing on toplevel users while stressing that cm in a lowlevel component to me that is a blatant contradiction that produces drawbacks which i presented in several usage examples which you didnt address while you always reply with a single use case where the user is yourself i.e a cm developer anyone else who is using a highlevel application based on cm will be baffled by the detailed exception message because in all but the most trivial case his actions will have only a remote connection to the exception triggered by cm im pinpointing at a minute detail of the design of cm explaining that it can come in the way of some direct users of cm the current long list of errors is in fact imposing your view of what is important to future application developers an example lets say that someone wants to create a gui e.g for the statistician referred to above he will want to define his own detailed error messages to be displayed in the gui with a formatting of his choice the statistician will never see the messages created by if a cm exception resulting from a precondition violation reaches the enduser level it means there was some unanticipated problem in the call chain and to correct it one would need more than just the detailed message the enduser will pass the stack trace to the application developer who will correct a possible bug in his code such as a missing check of a precondition or pass it on the the cm developers
1977,gotten to the bottom of this patch attached
1978,test is covered by hbase5992 integrated to trunk thanks for the patch matteo thanks for the review andy
1979,new files sorry
1980,like richards update as well EMO_POS what i did was out of pure anger so it may not have been the sexiest
1981,i dont like this overall if cant reuse everywhere
1982,a lot for the reviews todd
1983,is a fullstack framework click is not
1984,amit vivek committed at r907620 ashish
1985,thanks yusaku
1986,please take a look at the patch when you get a chance if it looks fine you can go ahead and commit using git am
1987,hadoop6281
1988,about that fixed now
1989,again
1990,patch looks good and the tests ran cleanly i reindented some parts of the code since they had twice as much indentation as the surrounding code does your editor use tab width eight instead of four committed revision
1991,looks safe also
1992,hi luca ive applied the changes you mentioned and it worked fine on my end windows can you try this on your end as well ive attached the patch thanks
1993,like a good idea
1994,version still needs hudson right
1995,to branch hadoopeclipsemerge thanks srimanth
1996,we switch to antlr and even though im not sure this would fix the problem there is nothing we can do
1997,again uwe
1998,i am still having the same problem with the build can you please check this a.s.a.p best regards
1999,
2000,must be lost somewhere
2001,looked at our distributed pom.xml and theyre pretty obscure
2002,this is in solrland sorry thought it was lucene
2003,to trunk in in sorry about visad.unimplementedexception
2004,does not work well patch has been manually tested
2005,you mentioned in a gtalk conversation that you had a patch for this but i cant find it here in jira could you attach it please thanks
2006,vladimir the patch was applied to bti branch at r602881 please check that the patch was applied as you expected
2007,kathey and myrna the release note looks good and it passes the releasenotereaders checks
2008,been running with xmx1024m xms1024m before and that worked in the past not sure whats going on now
2009,had no idea about fetching binary data sorry is it flash looks like my patch addressed all three points failing only for handling raw bytes
2010,
2011,that fixes this problem and adds a test case demonstrating it
2012,and thanks for the review jd
2013,martina
2014,committed the patch branch1 also thank you andy and slavik
2015,rich thanks for taking the time to move forward on this i didnt have any junit problems at all with maven2 when i installed it but clearly were in a world of hardtoreplicate behaviors here EMO_POS what is the exact problem youre seeing
2016,for doing that uma
2017,be size
2018,the fix looks good enough seems there is a lot of dead or halfbroken code around st_print_frame exn_print_stack_trace but those deserve good refactoring all in all
2019,hell
2020,its me that didnt get the whole point now i got more sorry for the noise
2021,patch is attached
2022,good thanks for your work on this
2023,just committed this thanks raghu
2024,good claudio
2025,i just replaced my src with the latest in the trunk and did a compleatly clean build and the problem seems to have gone away
2026,found the class so there is no bug sorry
2027,gary i think i have a rather nice and elegant patch for this but if you dont mind waiting id like to get some clearance from my current employer thanks
2028,i took a quick look at your suggestions i agree that we can reduce the code a bit however i think that we need to keep the activate method as it initializes the servingxml internals im not sure about the deactivate method i also noticed that you have added a patch but being new to jira im not sure if that means that youve made changes to my attachment or something else are you still looking for me to correct the formatting and to remove the extraneous thanks james
2029,a patch with the typo fixed im going to try that along hbase6550 and hbase6165 now
2030,sandy thanks so much to give me such comments thats really helpful i will update this later
2031,dont care what we do as long as we dont change the attributes in jsp significantly
2032,may want to carefully examine your assumption about this
2033,all resolved tickets from or older
2034,still not in love with the sarcasm or excessive negativity ill just point a few things out i didnt veto anything and this has nothing to do with i think it is a bad idea for us to generate code in a way that causes semantics to silently change when a new optional field is added this in dangerous in the long term i have no problem reverting this change restoring the old constructor and marking in deprecated is probably a good idea
2035,sorry i did not get back to you sooner
2036,ive created jira bookkeeper603 for the issue
2037,for fixing it so quickly
2038,fine thank you
2039,i dont know very much about the test framework differences
2040,for applied to trunk and j6
2041,i couldnt run your huge mb application sorry for asking again but will it be possible to post a test case actually that will also help you to isolate the issue venkat
2042,closing this bug from hell
2043,a very promising idea
2044,a patch that adds api for accessing the other info which is not writtent to trace file
2045,sorry i didnt upload the right files
2046,but even if we dont do that i suppose its also conceivable that someone might have their own similarity implementation that is expensive to instantiate ie maintains some big in memory data structures and might want to be able to declare one instance and then refer to it by name in many different fieldtype declarations i dont think this is really a use case we need to support the purpose of similarity today is to do term weighting not to be a huge datastructure holder while i know mikes original patch went this way with lucene2392 e.g norms im not sure i like it being in similarity in the future either otherwise concepts like lazyloading norms and all this other stuff get pushed onto the sim which is an awkward place imagine if you have many fields so i think we shouldnt really design for abuses of the api if there are other use cases for named similarity that have to do with term weighting im interested
2047,the issue to merge the changes into codeline
2048,i havent tried you patch
2049,is pretty trivial
2050,and now return null on transport failure so consistent behaviour with a close on the connection
2051,
2052,looks good i will commit this patch
2053,pat
2054,daisy could you please dispatch this review to one of your team mingfei did not respond on that and i would like to be certain we got all provided patches with us for thanks in advance svante
2055,i wish you didnt suck so much
2056,antonio i can take this one if nobody is working on it would be a nice one to get my feet wet EMO_POS thx sam
2057,will be great if you could confirm it either way first
2058,looks good to me
2059,patch here seems to be attached to a wrong jira sorry about the confusion i have reattached the path here
2060,it
2061,totally didnt know we support in for delete would prefer to fix by offering in for for the other statements as well the antlr doesnt look too daunting delete as an example knock on wood can take a stab at that tomorrow this is and was intentionally omitted remember not saying this is decision that cant be revisited just reminding oh and if we do move forward its post0.8 were in a featurefreeze EMO_POS
2062,ashish
2063,bug was introduced by URL
2064,mark for taking care of this issue
2065,into trunk and thanks
2066,committed to trunk and branch zhijie thanks for the patch
2067,by dennis byrne thanks a lot
2068,halfreuse is more confusing for new devs who see this code for the first time
2069,name
2070,thanks yongqiang
2071,doubt that squid is so bad at it
2072,URL deepal thanks
2073,not quite added this above entry to my web.xml but im unable to load the jdbc driver oracle.jdbc.driver.oracledriver whats weird is that this class is in cocoons normal classpath how do i specify the classpath once i get this answered either here or in cocoonusers which ive also asked ill close the bug
2074,commented on the commit of revision apparently replies on the commit messages dont make it back into jira so just for the record here is that comment i didnt follow this one but i notice setup and teardown do not call super.setup super.teardown respectively as per the idiom is there a reason for this here notably basejdbctestcase teardown does some cleaning up it may not be required here but its generally good to stick to the idiom houx zhang replied yes dag i agree with you and will adopt it looks like bryan already added super.teardown with revision
2075,patch file didnt apply cleanly heres a version that does
2076,have stupidly deleted the original test dir but judging from the suites output files no output was created after hours
2077,sure the key in reproducing it seems to be nonzero bytes following the terminal zero in the array received by it seems normal to not be able to reproduce it consistently i also have experienced dry runs because the buffer just happened to have been followed by an area of memory which was previously zeroed i tried to reproduce it on hpux as well but i failed crafting my own allocator did not help i have spent a couple of hours on it and i am sorry i cannot spend more time to shed some more light all builds on all platforms with all compilers exhibit failures in the same tests in the same place i would say this is pretty compelling evidence coupled with the spurious failures on selected platforms that there is a problem i have my money on EMO_POS liviu
2078,is clearly bad webserver behaviour
2079,mirdul committed in trunk r903428 and r903429
2080,all resolved tickets from or older
2081,additional example URL
2082,really sucks
2083,for the very clear explanation of the needed change dag
2084,one possibility is that gettoken of opp can return hex value if it fails to encode bytes to utf8 instead of throwing error i cant think of how it would break anything to accept keys we previously rejected
2085,looks good to me too thanks for all the work
2086,adrien for looking into this nice explanation
2087,just tested the shiro trunk with karaf2.2 release and everything works fine EMO_POS
2088,that sucks
2089,
2090,eli didnt realize you were going to look at testdatanodeblockscanner too i did extensive mods to it as part of hdfs1295 lets take a look and compare
2091,so can you see if you can git bisect this bad boy
2092,let me know if you need something else
2093,folks the full fix was committed in rather a messy manner due to some platform specific issues
2094,it works ok now thanks
2095,tony
2096,default assembly behaviour in preflight
2097,thanks
2098,patch looks good thanks jian and zhijie bikas for the reviews
2099,
2100,on cursory review i like the cleanup and the tightening checking target servername too before going ahead op
2101,creating the derbytest i did notice that this problem is caused by the database pool because it tries to connect to the database in the background
2102,is the debian build of the rc that sylvain just put up
2103,took a quick look at d unused locals most of it looks good but i dont understand the few places where for backward compatibility there is what looks like a useless statement just to make sure a property gets read wont someone else someday follow up with patch h that removes what seems to be useless code and just take those out anyway
2104,off hints is basically intended as a oh shit something is broken with hints lets turn it off switch
2105,thanks for the fast review
2106,for the delay
2107,a potential fix for this close and hflush now may throw interruptedioexception if the thread has interrupt status its a bit tricky because they wont throw it if they werent going to block they will return immediately with interrupt status preserved
2108,forget the patch for the moment
2109,andrew for covering me
2110,about that URL
2111,thanks navis
2112,just committed this thanks amareshwari
2113,shit
2114,defect from hell be scared
2115,galder EMO_POS
2116,chuck is scary
2117,does not look very useful
2118,coop thanks robert mike for picking this up
2119,you run the train command you get an error in the model serializer i suggest to train on the ppa data set serialize the model and then load it again to ensure there are no runtime errors in this code path its also easier to debug in an ide if it fails in a junit test that is the exception i get caused by java.lang.nullpointerexception at at at at at at at at more
2120,forgot that dev lists were merged before jmeter was made tlp
2121,equally bad
2122,my stupid EMO_POS
2123,awdesh done at r821748
2124,to branch thanks eli
2125,the above comes across as terse
2126,ashutosh and gunther for your help
2127,for my delay i would have answered early but i completely missed the notification mail about christianos comment EMO_NEG USER_MENTION ive just tested it again and it seams to work for me karafUSER_MENTION list start level list threshold id state blueprint level name apache shiro core apache servicemix bundles ehcache apache shiro support ehcache looking into the shiro ehcache pom i found the following org.apache.shiro.ehcache unable to resolve missing requirement package says that youre using an old snapshotversion of shiro ehcache this could happen with the snapshots since karaf simply takes what it could find in your local mvn repo either simply remove your local folder and let maven grep the latest version or build shiro yourself locally should fix the problem sorry again for the delay and kind regards andreas
2128,close as this is just me being stupid
2129,thanks a lot very much ashish
2130,arvind
2131,for catching this i have fixed it
2132,an existing subshard gets stuck up
2133,that should be filechannel inputchannel input.getchannel filechannel outputchannel output.getchannel in the try block
2134,committed the patch to trunk could you please submit a patch for the branch this one doesnt apply cleanly thanks
2135,if this was not clear and yes by i meant an empty string
2136,fix patch
2137,just committed this thanks aaron
2138,bad i screwed up the assertion runtimeexception transition
2139,is fixed in cvs post
2140,attached
2141,an attachment relevant portion of stack dump
2142,to branch USER_MENTION any chance of some trunk love EMO_POS if not i will get to it later
2143,i guess im against never computing this shit because you guys think returning nan is ok
2144,moved
2145,you gregory eugene verified on harmonyr547521msvcdebug
2146,patch does not apply snapshot branch ff25969ea0b2ff38cc25512a02569c351e757d66 looks like this is built upon some of the online snaphots work what does this go on matteo
2147,results are awesome paul great work EMO_POS looking forward to see your new json parser in trunk whenever you think is ready
2148,patch i plan to commit in a day or two
2149,can we close this
2150,for valuable idea i havent yet decided the api for this once i decide i will publish it here i would consider your valuable suggestion when designing api thanks indika
2151,would be interesting
2152,is committed to the trunk thanks niraj
2153,was a very bad bug introduced by me being an idiot
2154,that sucks
2155,
2156,rest are unrelated
2157,draft refactor code to prepare for work mentioned above testloadincrementalhfiles passes
2158,to close this david but the messenger component headed over to codehaus where i think its pretty much dead
2159,koji
2160,am sorry if you think this is nit picking but the logged error still refers to plugins.xml but it should not error config.xml is missing add to your project
2161,thanks robert
2162,patch looks good
2163,issue oozie is released
2164,elena
2165,about that
2166,either you query the database every damn time and your will be super slow
2167,addeploymentproblem failed since we have deltaspike262 we should just enable it again for v0.4
2168,applied revision
2169,sucks why isnt the escape mechanism working
2170,patch should apply cleanly to the current trunk please review
2171,the issue of extracting runtime library info from asm module
2172,i clicked the submit too quickly the revision number is r501311
2173,looks good
2174,is good to have the test
2175,this bug is fixed
2176,am not sure how the build system check for ant tar failed it appears to be working from the console output
2177,i hit close by accident
2178,thanks for the patch jd
2179,revision
2180,whole thing is really pretty trivial
2181,patch is in URL thank you vasanth jarcec
2182,
2183,thanks
2184,for me thank you alexei
2185,understood can you recreate the patch its out of sync with head at the moment
2186,jason i was thinking one of those parameters was the time the nm should wait before sending the sigterm alas i was wrong sends the sigterm pretty much instantly that is messing me up in mapreduce4135 im still thinking having a small time delay before sending even the sigterm should be good if we can do it on the nm and not on the rm i think we might be able to conserve rm resources
2187,patch looks good i have committed this
2188,idea
2189,with revision
2190,this is a performance killer
2191,bryan for converting these tests in using the derby2152 conversion tool can you double check that it does not omit the fail assert method after a method call in a trycatch block when the statement is expected to fail e.g instead of try catch sqlexception e e it should be try expected to fail command catch sqlexception e e
2192,good applied thanks URL
2193,bad
2194,is quite uncomfortable to work with
2195,have attached the modifications to the clientstubwriter.java in wsdl this modification will solve the problem but i didnt check further memory leaks with the modifications
2196,thanks for report even if im not sure empty password is a good idea EMO_POS
2197,you using the latest agent code i had verified on with latest kvm agent jar copied to kvm host and tried it worked without issues edision had implemented this with the above commit mentioned last saturday i had verified it and its working migrating volume across wide is working perfectly
2198,bad this is already done
2199,
2200,thanks siying
2201,garbage collection on transient and durable queue message managers also added a check on capacity limit before removing idle containers
2202,good to me markus
2203,about the error guys
2204,jinjie
2205,seems really confusing
2206,revision
2207,is a duplicate of qpid2488
2208,just committed this thanks eli
2209,apologize for taking so long to get to reviewing this this has some good elements but also quite a few problems here are a few suggestions the bindinggbeans do not need to know the name of the gbean they are getting something to bind into jndi from they need a reference to it similarly they do not need to bind a naming reference they can bind the object itself for instance the connector binding gbean can do something like this private final managedconnectionfactorywrapper managedconnectionfactorywrapper this is the reference to the gbean that gives us the connection factory to bind its time to bind the connection factory object connectionfactory connectionfactory this is also going to affect how the builders set up the binding gbeans they know the name of the appropriate gbean such as managedconnectionfactorywrapper since they just created it so they need to use that name to set the reference pattern in the binding gbean the binding gbean will then get a proxy to the real gbean that it can use as outlined above i dont see an implementation of a writable thread safe jndi context as dain pointed out you would need the zip file consists almost entirely of irrelevant files and the actual source files do not all appear to be in the geronimo project structure this makes it extremely hard to figure out what to look at some of the code modifications such as to serviceconfigbuilder appear to be test cases rather than production code it will be a lot easier to evaluate your work if you keep test cases and production code clearly separated as is done in typical maven projects i think you will need to redo the openejb work after dains reintegration of his container rewrite thanks let us know if you have any questions about this
2210,inline patch came out garbled same patch attached
2211,in this particular case hoss clearly intended to use the nono word as an intensifier and not to stir shit
2212,starting to think of dll hell
2213,course i totally agree with yonik i dont care that much what the default include is upper lower as long as it doesnt doublecount doublecounting is bad it can lead to a bad user experience theres something about lower that i feel makes it slightly better than upper but i cant really explain the rationale i dont think theres any point in compliance with legacy if nobody depended on the behavior they couldnt specify the behavior before either just because its easy to set the include doesnt mean the default is arbitrary any way if the default remains to doublecount im going to insist that my readers for the second edition of my book change this value
2214,i think you should just go ahead and port the fix to merge command svn merge r URL i have started working on a general checkthatresourcesarefreed test for derby23 derby210 and derby557 but while doing that i ran into another resource leak derby594 that i wanted to resolve first
2215,for the patch pending successful jenkins run for the latest version the changes look good i verified on both mac and windows thanks for addressing this andrey ill commit this after jenkins responds with for the latest version
2216,font size sounds reasonable thanks
2217,dont have very much experience on branch1 would you like to take a shot at the port
2218,im building mina myself from trunk just to be sure when i checkout the code from URL ill get always the latest code ill see if i can some up with a little application it may take a few days due to a lot of work ive to finish roger
2219,a lot willem EMO_POS
2220,martijn
2221,suck
2222,unaryfunction might even be faster than all of these calls in a row
2223,suspect it has nothing to do with the file system connector or infinispan connectors and is simply a stupid mistake in the federated join processor
2224,i see that you say the same mike EMO_POS
2225,that would be the case this would be bad design
2226,stupid user error here
2227,of camel6918
2228,seems good to me to apply it
2229,missed issue
2230,the patch has been applied as expected you can close the issue thanks
2231,now looks like a race in the tablename caching not related to the locking here
2232,patch looks good to me some minors javadoc for two getinode in snapshotdifflist.java we have directorydiff childrendiff diff snapshotdiff this is a little bit hard to follow how about some renaming like snapshotdiffordirectory snapshotdifforfile snapshotdiff d posterior final blocksmapupdateinfo collectedblocks can be renamed to deleteposterior or combineanddeleteposterior so as to distinguish with diff combineposterior
2233,of proposed change
2234,misread
2235,great job pat
2236,is attached
2237,for the review jimmy committed to trunk
2238,should have been very careful before doing this
2239,fuhwei i was a bit worried by the big override method in your patch so i have taken a good long look at this but as its an area of the code im not very familiar with i cant necessarily jump in with an expert comment my current analysis of this is that emf forces an assumption in the two lines of xsdecorebuilders createfeature method xsdtypedefinition elementtypedefinition xsdelementdeclaration eclassifier eclassifier that the type of an element is contained in the emf representation generated from the input schema so if we could override geteffectivetypedefinition and conditionally return an xsdtypedefinition from the metadata available within our sdo scope then we would be ok for the case where the type referenced in the schema was provided by an earlier xsd to sdo conversion i think we can retrieve this data and then do whatevers necessary if anything to get the eclassifier based on that type definition i havent spent the time to dig into that as i thought now was a good time to discuss this wouldnt cover the case where a schema writer was assuming some types were available that hadnt been produced from an xsd but i dont know that thats currently a realistic use case if my analysis is correct we could lobby emf to make a change so that the above two lines were incorporated into a single protected method call that didnt require the eclassifier lookup to proceed via an xsdtypedefinition instance then our override would be able to return an eclassifier based on the xsdcomponent and xsdelementdeclaration directly what do you think have i missed point here
2240,committed this to and above thanks corinne
2241,regards andrew
2242,signed shift
2243,misunderstood the issue
2244,for providing this update will try to take a look at this sometime this week
2245,to trunk and branch thanks arup
2246,for the reviews
2247,candidate of this patch this patch contains add ip address to crawldatum version as a ipaddress resolver map runnable tool to lookup the ips multithreaded add a property to define if the ipaddress resolver should be started as a part of the crawldb update tool to update the parseoutput folder contains crawldatum status linked of a segment before updating the crawldb using cached ip during generation please review this patch and give me any improvement suggestion i think this is a very important issue since it helps to do whole web crawls and not end up in a honey pot after some fetch iterations also if you like please vote for this issue EMO_POS thanks
2248,just committed this thanks sanjay
2249,audit warning are ok the new files dont need apache headers the patch is good to go
2250,i will review and apply
2251,just committed this to both trunk and mr279 thanks jeffrey
2252,evil npe strik back
2253,heres the test that reproduces the issue
2254,did this not patch
2255,for the misspelling EMO_POS
2256,its been good to be able to contribute and i hope to be able to more for this awesome project when i have the spare time
2257,thanks ashish
2258,setreaderthread i didnt know we had such a method it looks like it was added here URL other than adding documentation to ftpclient about this it sounds like like there isnt any other action to take on this report
2259,just committed this thank you scott and priyo
2260,
2261,sure as hell dont want to start attaching models for the sake of detaching them directly afterwards
2262,am planning to use this framework for some new rpcs i am adding
2263,of clk121 which is already fixed thanks malcolm
2264,i will do that adrian thanks for taking a look at this EMO_POS
2265,for delay this patch is including lru cache but changing static class into member is not done what should i do
2266,for a mess in uploaded files my connection got broken during first upload
2267,im probably not an jmx expert EMO_POS
2268,to branch and trunk thanks for the review stack
2269,add resuabletoken support to this patch
2270,in r823180 thx robert
2271,im attaching a patch which adds a second query method to solrserver which takes the request method as the second argument shouldnt that be specific to an http server
2272,hairong
2273,complicatedasshitalgorithm batman the complexity of our implementation vs the complexity of what were actually doing is starting to worry me here
2274,i missed a cast
2275,no worries
2276,failoverslave2b.diff committed as revision
2277,senaka for the patch
2278,i just downloaded trunk and the patch is the same with mine so ill close the issue now one comment though and sorry for nitpicking shouldnt the second constructor simply be null or even better default in any case i can confirm it works it just looks a bit ugly duplicating code like that EMO_POS
2279,ian this looks brilliant to me so fat from me
2280,woflexair commented joan sorry for the noise in the bugbase but its not a bug
2281,for delay
2282,to trunk thanks for the review alan
2283,recovery mechanism jira at hbase4652
2284,accountnames steffkes otis shalin stefan otis and erik ive added all of you to the solrcommitters solradmins and confluenceadministrators groups
2285,revision
2286,thats one hell of a bug bytes exactly eh
2287,updated the rb just now sorry no perf numbers yet let me run some experiments for that thanks
2288,vikram sorry about that i havent paid much attention to this issue
2289,thanks
2290,i have rebased the patch based on the latest master branch please review and let me know if any changes are required
2291,there is another thing here by deferring the evictions to the background thread you increase the chance that the block will be tenured then it must be collected from cms space thus radically increasing the gc complexity of the cache originally when the lru block cache came in it made my collections as slow until i disabled the block cache for compactions unfortunately all these microoptimizations might be falling under the gc wayside
2292,good
2293,but look at mapsubtract and further down in the source you will find plenty
2294,youre right that idea was probably not the best approach to the problem looks really nice looking forward to it EMO_POS
2295,hopefully someone else will improve this code when theyve got some time
2296,jihoon thank you for your contribution sergio thank you for your review
2297,anders i agree with knut this issue can be marked as fixed thanks a lot for working on this improvement suresh
2298,get it fixed soon sorry for the inconvenience i just wanted to point you and others who may land here to alternative resources meanwhile EMO_POS
2299,applied in revision
2300,dont care if everything is pretty or not but we should at least support basic admin functionality in ie imo though i have not used it for years for just about anything
2301,at and thanks blas
2302,thanks the patch is applied as expected
2303,if tarball is specified hod no longer validates for the pkgs directory in gridservicehdfs or mapred sections as these are not going to be used anyway
2304,
2305,revision i applied the patch from URL this fixes the problem
2306,to edward and brock for the reviews
2307,
2308,this is a very desired feature for me ship it
2309,a lot for the review todd the test failure is unrelated and is already tracked by another jira im going to commit this momentarily
2310,thanks so much for the submission scott
2311,i would love to help test a patch EMO_POS im currently using zookeeper744 zookeeper790 applied in that order
2312,both at are bad
2313,that sucks
2314,sorry for making it confusing
2315,the fix is good please close this jira thanks a lot
2316,existing from moin moin wiki now copied across to confluence jira and reformatted as appropriate should now all be updating on confluence wiki and retire moin moin in a couple of weeks when people have been able to check that their pages look ok on confluence
2317,bad
2318,you very much for your effort david
2319,the code above is a copy of the charsetutil class just run within a junit test case there is no exception other than junit.framework.assertionfailederror are you able to reproduce the error thanks richard
2320,patch adds some getting started documentation and also a new page about configuration ive removed the individual pages for services in the absence of something to write there but we can add back as needed ive also commented out some broken links that wont be live until we do a release i think we could make this live now thoughts btw before applying the patch run svn mv
2321,then we dont save io by limiting the buffer size to kb im confused by this
2322,a lot for sharing that josh
2323,license headers
2324,patch looks good
2325,cb675 see my latest comment there regarding cordova
2326,ive been mia on this issue
2327,thanks raghu thats awesome and will save me a ton of time
2328,to trunk and branch0.4 thanks rohini
2329,was my bad
2330,to trunk thanks for the patch ramkrishna thanks for the review michael and jd
2331,we are no longer using xerces
2332,try EMO_POS i was mr i dont believe in magic from the very beginning
2333,thomas
2334,for that its sometimes hard for us to describe a usecase that is so clear for us but indeed not always for somebody else thanks for the time and well try harder to explain in the future about the jira issue well try with full urls instead this worked in and so we thought it was a bug but now we know that its just not supported anymore
2335,im fine with your logic but given that i dont understand it please dont get upset when i ask questions on how i have to use it
2336,again i tried with the same revision same language same theme and i use also ff4 and i still dont reproduce see screenshot1 it would be interesting ot have other persons tests
2337,misunderstood the case and sorry for the confusion
2338,guillaume i did not have an answer right away so i sent you question to leonard rosenthol
2339,was a temporary connectivity issue you can close this bug thank you
2340,thanks jingwei
2341,catch interruptedexception ignore resetting the interrupt status of the thread is a good idea when we cant just rethrow the interruptedexception but imho we should in that case throw a tikaexception to indicate that the requested operation couldnt be completed normally catch interruptedexception e throw new e when the call is interrupted we cant just blindly assume that the process completed normally explicitly throwing an exception is a better approach in such cases
2342,the user passwords are too insecure
2343,i thought i did resolve this
2344,to hack your issue bilgin my intention is to keep readable traces in ml you cant read easily stack
2345,regards andrew
2346,patch synched with trunk
2347,excellent really sweet where does the jar come from and whats its license the rest api looks good very resty there might be little nitpicks later but for it looks great how different is it from current rest should the two be the same if not how to deprecate the old the annotations look interesting could their serializations be used in other contexts the shell say or warning crazythought coming somehow producing thrift idl in line lengths are chars your new classes are missing apache license classes are missing comments describing what class is about etc is there anything we could do refactoring htable say so your modeling was easier looks like lots of code in your cell and database controllers should our client be taking on this model can you add a note on how youve changed how rest works highlevel thats all for now
2348,but im not sure who owes me a public apology here
2349,is protected by lock also extract and removeat and before invoking extract and removeat there has check to make sure count not zero so i cant see any chance that count could be invalidate in extrac and removeat
2350,and zoo_amulti crash for the same reason made some local fixes here
2351,rather we dont work on older versions if this is still an issue in please submit a new patch for thanks
2352,uwe
2353,you make sure that the following path exists on your machine it sometimes happen that tomcat for some reason fails to open the war which results in an incomplete deployment
2354,fine to me oleg
2355,have committed this thanks junping
2356,is that the sheer size of cfstore over line annoys me i think this prove cfstore has too much things in it and we messed up at encapsulation so i tried to make datatracker be about dealing with the memtables and sstables as much as possible and being able to have view not leak from datatracker sound like a proof that we do have some encapsulation there im not claiming its perfect but i really dont think that cfstore is our most beautiful class in there and i do believe that datatracker improves this a bit but there is a good part of subjectivity in all this anyway and if people really dont like the move of the bits of querying in there fine id move them back in cfstore and leak the view from datatracker i would however be more reluctant to remove datatracker altogether and put the atomicreference in cfstore because this would move all the cas related logic in cfstore and seriously there is already too much stuff in cfstore my humble opinion though
2357,URL
2358,it sry lost the orientation
2359,like this is fixed EMO_POS
2360,for the explanation for the patch
2361,issues which have been released
2362,good bq i didnt add version to stopfilter nor stopanalyzer i think its better to upfront require the enablepositionincrements to their ctors i would add it to stopanalyzer stopfilter is not so important because lowlevel but thats my opinion
2363,patch was wrong here a new one
2364,think this is pretty close to being ready
2365,it back in if you think different
2366,all resolved tickets from or older
2367,debugging is hell because the test environment needs to have the exact same loader setup
2368,committed this change thanks for reporting the issue kazuki index revision working copy USER_MENTION USER_MENTION initialize zookeeper and master address manager this.zookeeper getzookeeperwatcher masteraddresstracker new this masteraddresstracker.start this.rootregiontracker new this
2369,draft this just does the mapping in the constructor to the comparator we could do setnextreader but i cant imagine it will really make much difference given the small number of items that we typically would expect to be elevated
2370,patch looks good i want to wait until falcon85 is committed to commit this else ill have to regenerate the merge patch sorry about that
2371,only committed to the trunk at present you can check this by selecting the all tab in the activity section USER_MENTION anything other to do here im asking because the issue is still in the status open any reason not to back port this feature also to our and feature branch
2372,would love it in will upload a patch for that version
2373,resolution to wfm
2374,it at the hackathon youd have a few fellas at your shoulder to give you pointers should you get stuck
2375,kind of annoying to have to use of temporary space nope it only writes the compressed file to disk compresses of zeros to mib

2377,back from vacation have updated the code with required changes it should be good to go now pradeep can you or any other committer review it
2378,is not well formed cancel patch sorry about this
2379,looks good to me pending beta8
2380,alejandro
2381,thank you lohit then should we close this issue
2382,confused
2383,thanks neeme
2384,the patch looks good to me
2385,for the patch erik and jon
2386,sorry
2387,and spark updated patch applied at revision r447348 thanks a lot for this enhancement please verify that the problem is fully fixed as you expected
2388,looks good to me patchs been committed thanks awesome to now be able both the and messaging api through the same interface this is going to save us a lot of headaches EMO_POS
2389,or high water
2390,patch looks good
2391,that replaces the numeric constant value with the symbolic name of the enumerated constant
2392,i dont understand are you saying that this will not be fixed for and the workaround is to set thanks chris
2393,upped the httpd timeout from mins to i didnt see any outofmemoryerrors in the logs so hopefully this will fix it please give it another try
2394,jacques EMO_POS
2395,konstantins comment thanks mayank
2396,trunk and branch thanks for the patch n
2397,looks like all changes in rmappimpl are unnecessary
2398,an attachment patch to apsupport.m4 to support amd64
2399,to trunk thanks harish
2400,thats it since it fixes the problem ill commit the fix
2401,just committed this to trunk thank you uma the patch does not apply to branch any more i recommend it for back porting
2402,not sure what the problem is but the behavior at least in is that the atomicboolean is not being set to closed in a timely manner
2403,this to keep track of progress in wtps bug
2404,an attachment patch to o.a.c.l.systemutils.java modified declaration order
2405,please accept that my logical is different from your logical
2406,patch looks good
2407,to clarify you made the dtpe handle exceptions the same way as cassandradaemon by updating it to use nbhs instead of csls did you just tell me to go fuck myself
2408,dont understand why we need these methods since they are inherited from inetaddress so we are compliant with the spec
2409,which version do i need to apply the patch on
2410,looks good to me
2411,got the time to try it yet
2412,an attachment lazydynaclass test case
2413,would need to implement session resume thats a whole new can of worms
2414,replaced treemap with an array of final segment objects now very slightly faster than trunk rebased for trunk removed the patch renaming sstablereadertest to segmentedfiletest i didnt remove the builder pattern because the alternative seems pretty ugly copying the segments array for every append
2415,bruno i like it seems to work well at glance thanks
2416,dont care about code duplication here
2417,committed this thanks jay
2418,thiwanka i assume youre referring to this code which checks the character offset and produces progress events if the xmllocator has advanced at least public void startelement qname element xmlattributes attributes augmentations augs throws xniexception reportprogressevents nextcharoffset nextcharoffset reportprogressevents nextcharoffset the abstractdomparser.startelement attributes augs that looks fine to me just mentioned this to ishara in future it would be easier to review changes if you created a patch e.g diff u which shows the differences between the previous version generally also better to add source files as an attachment to the jira issue rather than including it directly as a comment this makes it easier to review and apply to the codebase thanks
2419,to work reliably now
2420,we can replace wsnhttpbinding in the future
2421,looked at what can be done within the nsis framework we use to build the windows installer
2422,guys for saving mankind
2423,karthik i committed this to trunk branch2 and branch2.1beta
2424,i notice that the line still doesnt have latency metrics if youd like me to rerun for those stats i can just need to rebase off of cassandra6153 or rewrite my tool to use a known good cassandrastress right now it just takes the one from the same branch its testing
2425,fix this post rampart1.3
2426,
2427,for the patch greg applied at r1153789
2428,sorry priorities have been shifted around
2429,thanks zheng
2430,brock
2431,thanks chatra
2432,thanks looks good
2433,USER_MENTION in trunk
2434,looks good to me
2435,put the info in this file on people rwx dblevins dblevins jul
2436,pdf which demonstrates the problem
2437,to and trunk thanks jerry for the patch and stack for the review
2438,commented two test failed org.apache.hadoop.hive.cli.testnegativeminimrclidriver.testnegativeclidriver_mapreduce_stack_trace_hadoop20 org.apache.hcatalog.fileformats.testorcdynamicpartitioned.testhcatdynamicpartitionedtable can you assert that i cannot reproduce
2439,good information to have thanks lance
2440,call me crazy but why are we making this public
2441,revision committed revision committed revision
2442,sorry i forgot to mention this EMO_POS but a header where this is stored would work great and probably there should be a config item if you want it or not
2443,revision
2444,
2445,but this is just stupid
2446,aaron
2447,right i didnt check what the warning was about and assumed it was due to your patch resubmitting it and yes ill create a jira for the findbugs warning
2448,cool
2449,and was my first commit thanks to all
2450,obliged thank you EMO_POS
2451,alvaro lot of things need to be done at the same time but i am still not clear what you want me to do change i put links on topright now URL what about the links to the tutorials you want to put those in the section installation and upgrade right sebastian
2452,to trunk
2453,to trunk thanks thejas
2454,looks cool
2455,mind figured it out will be committing patch in the next few days
2456,first of welcome EMO_POS thank you
2457,unit test sorry but theres not much deltaquery coverage anyway
2458,seems to not honour the npm proxy in fact thats the problem
2459,the patch looks good to me i will commit this later
2460,for
2461,is a version of this patch due to a lack to time on my part this has not been compiled or tested sorry please test if you can
2462,last patch was missing new files
2463,just seems really evil
2464,this is not the right fix hdfs can depend on mapreduce please remove the dependence completely
2465,committed revision
2466,like this problem is bigger than i thought i cant even get a simple form without dotstuffing to work parsing this simple script require reject tag reply if anyof header contains subject test reply reply text this is the first line this is the second line stop results in org.apache.jsieve.parser.generated.tokenmgrerror lexical error at line column encountered after at at at
2467,alok agnihotri for your valuable patch special thanks to rishi patel and others in helping alok changes are in rev ashish vijaywargiya
2468,to mention thanks to alejandro and his team for pointing this one
2469,one more thing on the tests you have if jvminfo.jdk_id test should it b if jvminfo.jdk_id
2470,about that
2471,i think we are all on the same page then well move forward down this route thanks for taking a look
2472,now realize hadoop1662 is required so i will wait thanks
2473,you for the patch sergey
2474,thanks
2475,after investigation the real source of the problem is when a tag is using dots apparently xmlconfiguration does not support this should it
2476,is for making reduce value iterators cloneable hadoop531 is for sorting on multiple keys
2477,suggestion claus and thanks alexander for the fast realization
2478,an attachment ssl guide take
2479,suggest a potspone to as we will redesign the chain
2480,i didnt consider one flow like after the edit log conversion immediately store failed
2481,fix to interchange the order of constructor arguments of clientidandtopic
2482,do you think attached patch is generic nothing is generic until its used in more than one place the above isnt complete it needs e.g read and seek implementations but it looks like a good start but the real question is to you could you use the above can you present the data and checksums as input streams that support int int and it also assumes a particular checksum implementation crc32 if we wish to allow for others that aspect could be generalized by adding a codeclike interface for checksummers but i think we should probably skip that this iteration
2483,look reasonable to me
2484,i put a comment here which was for another issue tired as said already
2485,also applied to the native sdo repo on revision
2486,can also see this would get screwed up in zookeeper mode if the elevate file didnt exist
2487,jarcec
2488,thanks maheshwaran
2489,clicked the wrong button its intended for inclusion
2490,isnt a bug these tests are outdated and it was unclear that they were useful they have junit USER_MENTION annotations that cause them to be skipped on purpose
2491,a pretty strong on this
2492,i just didnt read the issues carefull enough
2493,was my accident i had the wrong jira opened this should have been filed against apache drill opened drill146 instead sorry
2494,an attachment proposed patch
2495,to trunk thanks edward
2496,like this make me sad
2497,think sstabledeletingtask is a good spot i just wasnt sure if that would be appropriate
2498,my bad sorry i indeed did not svn add the new classes since i dont have write access to the repository anyway but this way svn diff goes wrong of course i will submit a new patch on monday when im back at my working machine im really sorry for the incovencience
2499,close after is released
2500,it can be resolved thank you
2501,am checking out the dojo fixes and patching them in sorry for the delay it has been a long time
2502,just realized this might be hard each individual node cant really predict conflicts will happen so how would it avoid compacting away the shared parent
2503,colin i agree that typically refers to multiple input tuples of position length yes we can extend the api to include that the reason my original proposal did not include that was because i was mostly targetting this api to reduce the number of buffer copies
2504,an attachment patch
2505,can this be assigned to someone thanks
2506,i have not tried it yet but it looks good to me
2507,committed revision
2508,sorry for all the mess on a simple patch
2509,patch is attached
2510,patch looks good please submit the patch for verification so it can be committed into the trunk and merged all the way back thanks
2511,malcolm updated for the latest checkstyle christian
2512,go ahead
2513,oliver thats fixed it
2514,because of issues with rc5
2515,tom
2516,this is working fine for me please take a look at URL
2517,to branch and trunk thanks a ton kai
2518,geez im an idiot
2519,committed this to and trunk thanks for the patch gautam
2520,gianmarco thanks for your concern actually we need one additional step to make work we shall copy to this will be handled in ants package target when releasing but if you check out from svn we will do this additional step to work with
2521,for removing the getplatformpath code was applied at repo revision r818803
2522,revision thanks vinay
2523,for your comments konstantin
2524,it was not the only issue we also want to manage priorities between the tasks but we need to read them to get enough information to make the right priorities
2525,is used because we cant stream json row before we have all columns serialized columns serialized in portions according to page_size see sstableidentityiterator decoratedkey printstream method if you have a better idea then using stringbuilder in this case please share
2526,for your time
2527,back to dag
2528,issue for a partial revert as requested by tsuy see URL
2529,we cant do that because that is not explicit on the spec javadoc and there is a way to do what is expected using targets property
2530,first off i want to apologize for the belated patch review i know i told you id try to look at this months ago but yeah life tends to get in the way of patches on the whole things seem pretty good although you were still using an interface instead of an abstract class having the main api for a type of plugin be an abstract class is an important mechanism to help future proof ourselves against possible additions we want to make the the plugin api in the future if its an interface we cant really change it once its released because we might break people impls if its an abstract class we can always provide a default impl for people the biggest concern i have about this patch at the moment is that there are no tests and no example configs so its hard to be sure its even working at all EMO_POS heres what i see as the current todo list for this issue there are some legacy solrindexsearcher constructors that need to delegate to the solrcore to get indexreaderfactory perhaps we should have a helper method that decides which solrindexconfig to use based on the name we need tests showing custom indexreaderfactory getting used even if its just a mock indexreaderfactory thatsets a boolean to show its being used this will also serve as a test that config syntax works need commented out example of using a custom indexreaderfactory in sanity check this against solr465 make sure we arent painting ourselves into a corner we should make indexreaderfactory use the abstractpluginloader stuff and remove the guts of solrindexconfig.loadindexreaderfactory it looks like well need to add a single item version of load to the abstractpluginloader to make that work well is something that can be done after this is committed but are pretty important if you can update the patch with some ill think about the legacy solrindexsearcher constructors and try to figure out a good solution for them
2531,looks great thanks artem no more mixing in of fuzzyness into analyzingsuggester it looks like we are doing the utf8 conversion det twice per lookup once in convertautomaton and once in getfullprefixpaths but i think this is inevitable the first conversion is on the straight automaton for exactfirst match and the second one is on the lev automaton for nonexactfirst really we should only do the first convertautomaton if exactfirst is true but this is an optimization so we dont need to fix it now
2532,cant think of a good reason to snapshot the entire keyspace and doing so can dramatically increase the space needed to enable snapshot_before_compaction
2533,of couchdb1415
2534,for your patch and your investigations i reopen the issue will apply the patch soon
2535,that adds this in along with some extra whitespace removal from that chunk of the javadoc
2536,compiler works more or less good enough not perfect but it should minimize the manual labor we have to perform
2537,to hudson
2538,thanks for the complete testcase sorry about taking so long to fix this one thanks rick
2539,to trunk with revision committed to with revision
2540,patch applied to fop trunk see r793095 thanks for the fix
2541,just committed this thanks amareshwari
2542,thanks hitesh
2543,the new patch looks good
2544,up in pb thanks for the reviews
2545,work but its a halfway hack to the real fix we should do in my points is that i think it is a good idea in general to raise this timeout while adding configs so you dont necessarily have to wait since smallish clusters could use the max param if they want to speed this up we have run into the situation where not all rs came in the second window which really is too small given heartbeat frequency so ive already ramped up the config timeout for fb production but im fine implementing the halfway fix if my argument still doesnt win you over EMO_POS
2546,the patch with revision thanks carlin for the detailed updates and for all the fixed doubledashes EMO_POS
2547,for the late reply your corrections look good ive just applied them thanks
2548,layout
2549,nice the patch looks good emanuele EMO_POS
2550,j2eecontextimpl.newcontext to j2eecontextimpl.newmodulecontext
2551,patch changes look trivial thanks
2552,class funny coincidence EMO_POS what are you thoughts about queryparser being able to know about custom query implementations
2553,user error EMO_POS
2554,the hell is this not a bug
2555,brandon let me know if the attached patch is sufficient it looks like the following address dc rack status state load owns token my bad thanks jarcec that clarifies committed to branch4.0 and trunk thanks rohini thanks ravi
2556,nandana
2557,it back in if you think different
2558,
2559,how this warms my heart to see this thanks daniel i know youve worked hard on this EMO_POS
2560,guy on our team that was going to do this was swamped so i reassigned this to you
2561,rupert sorry it took so long but i thought id test building in a linux environment too so i set up a centos machine running maven and java got the exact same error on both machines i have attached corresponding logs both from windows8 and centos to this issue link here URL kind regards esse edit ill also run mvn clean install for just jenatdb with logging when i get home
2562,patch applied at revision r440604 thanks a lot for this enhancement please verify that the problem is fully fixed as you expected
2563,tom
2564,code looks good
2565,is quality work

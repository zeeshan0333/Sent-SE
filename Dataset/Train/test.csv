11,1,I'm glad we were able to resolve this issue.
12,0,if you like; please push this in.
13,0,planning to do that in a separate changelist for MB-14866: 1. merge lock with seqno_list into the same structure 2. maintain a vbMap instead of vbList in this service; so as to make vbno lookup/validation faster 3. do vbno validation in all relevant places in the service  you mentioned that we could use list of list instead of map of list to avoid issues with map. Feel that it makes the code harder to read. we may have to understandard the behavior with maps anyway. Plan to make the changes above and see if the issue in MB-14866 re-cur.

17,0,The patch in FOP-1099 fixes it; though.
18,1,I've decided to use the FreeFileSync tool from There is some effort to configure it to ignore some files and folders; but the tool provides nice filter possibilities. Configuring these filters can be very time consuming but they're working fine :) Thank's for all your help!

23,1,Hi I just started playing with Mongoose. It seems pretty awesome! Now coming from a Django background; how would one implement a type of options field like: So that it can be set like status = Open or something like that. Or should this just be a normal String field and I set it accordingly in my app?
24,0,Consolidate all error handling in KafkaServerStarble.

27,1,Awesome - great stuff Maria.  Thanks!
28,1,There is a book called which details pen and paper drawing and what you can gain from it. I think it has a lot of benefits; particularly that you can; very early on (and easily); modify what the end result will be without much effort; and then start off on the right foot.

34,0,Remove from 0.20.205; in hopes that HDFS-2342 did indeed fix TestHdfsProxy.testHdfsProxyInterface.
35,1,Excellent; thankyou!
36,0,This looks good to me as a first step - tested with both config and schema errors.  Would be nice if single core with the solr.xml also worked; but no biggie - we can fix with the rest of multi-core.  bq.  Note for no good reason what so ever;  Well; I think it was supposed to work (even though the whole idea is kind of broken anway); cause it attempted to; so reason is prob a bug ...

42,1,This sounds like an excellent project! You might want to start with the module. You might also be interested in the module. Perhaps to get you started; here's a function that takes a path to a file and backs the file up by copying it and giving it a .bak extension.

47,1,The patch looks good to me. Some minors:  1. javadoc for two getINode() in SnapshotDiffList.java  2. We have DirectoryDiff; ChildrenDiff; Diff; SnapshotDiff; this is a little bit hard to follow. How about some renaming like SnapshotDiffForDirectory; SnapshotDiffForFile?  3. SnapshotDiff#combinePosterior(final D posterior; final BlocksMapUpdateInfo collectedBlocks) can be renamed to deletePosterior; or combineAndDeletePosterior; so as to distinguish with Diff#combinePosterior?

64,1,There was an excellent presentation at WWDC this year on advanced scrollview techniques. You may want to spend an hour watching that. It might be of great help to you in this situation. The video is available in iTunes under the iTunes U section or from the apple developer site.
65,0,I'll make that change and close the issue.
66,-1,Guy's I am at my wit's end. I've got a VPS that I'm mucking around on; so nothing is important; but nginx is being a complete pain. I've deleted all of the content inside and restarted. Visting the ip of the server simply results in a page with one word on it: I just don't get it. Is this normal nginx behaviour? I've deleted the entire conf file and restarted; so why is this happening?
67,0,the current command is modeled after the export shell command.

71,-1,"FYI this probably doesn't always work. Booleans are stored as CHAR(1) with value Y for true and N for false. Not every JDBC driver out is going to grok this as a boolean value. It would be safer to use ""Y"".equals(rs.getString()) in code such as this.  Can't this statement also be written as an UPDATE:  UPDATE accounts SET reverse_patch_set_order = 'Y' WHERE display_patch_sets_in_reverse_order = 'Y';  UPDATE accounts SET show_username_in_review_category = 'Y' WHERE display_person_name_in_review_category = 'Y';  This should be much faster to process; and every SQL server we support will grok those two small statements. And it avoids the problem with boolean conversion."
72,0,This means you've picked up a version built against Hadoop 1.x; hence the FILE_NAME vs interface exception.

88,0,A database is meant to manage large volumes of data; and are supposed to give you fast access to read and write that data in spite of the size. Put simply; they manage scale for data - scale that you don't want to deal with. If you have only a few users (hundreds?); you could just as easily manage the data on disk (say XML?) and keep the data in memory. The images should clearly not go in to the database so the question is how much data; or for how many users are you maintaining this database instance?

97,-1,I just got through this exact problem. What a pain! If you are running a 32-bit JVM on a 64-bit Windows; make sure that you set the execution policy for the 32-bit Powershell interface. I found my 32 bit executable here: The 32- and 64-bit Powershell environments are completely distinct so setting the execution policy in one has no effect on the other.

104,0,#NAME?
105,0,Attached another refresh
106,0,We usually make file of constants an interface instead of a class (and prefix the name of an 'I').  You would also add in the javadoc of the interface the line  /** @noimplement This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.*/ to allow us to add more elements to the file without breaking an API.  Note that this package is internal; so we don't have to worry about API; but it is still good valid to put that javadoc entry.
107,0,I would rather not have specific vendor JDK names listed in there if can be avoided anyway.
108,0,"While we're changing the names of these triggers; let's fix the spelling of the word ""exceed"" as well. I think ""unmark_quota_exceed_upd_set"" should still be short enough."
109,0,I wonder if there's a point in using Revision::newFromId( $revid; Revision::READ_LATEST ) when $revid !== null. Or maybe doing it on-demand from the callback below.
110,0,Unfortunately if you want to make this an open API; many people will be unable to use Content-Type headers. The sad reality is that you usually need to allow some hacks; even if you permit the standardized way too.

121,-1,but; that is supposed to be there. I think it's confusing having some functions being vbucket_* and some others being lcbvb_* -- so that's why the comment is there; so I can fix this up at a later commit. Let me do that right now actually.. http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/CCBC-431

Now; the requirements in laravel docs() say minimal version of php on server required is 5.3.7; our servers have php 5.3.23. I am right now on a weekend; so i cant check my code on the server( been developing the basics on localhost with xampp which has latest php).

158,0,You also might want to check out Uche Ogbuji's excellent XML Data Binding Library; Amara: (Documentation here: ) The cool thing about Amara is that it turns an XML document in to a Python object; so you can just do stuff like: (which creates a Record element that contains Name and Value elements (which in turn contain the values of the name and value variables)).

171,0,Do you mean you checked your proposition or mine?
172,-1,Sorry; I'd accidentally deleted the --disable-eventfd from my compilation script.
173,0,I've left this unchaned for the following reasons: - emitEvent is supposed to forward the event to the vtkTransferFunction object and is a pure virtual method that subclasses override. I don't want to add additional burden to subclass developers to have to manage firing the signal - current code can handle event order nicely since it knows which is start and which is end i.e. a typical order is  ControlPointsItem->StartEvent; TransferFunction->StartEvent ... TranferFunction->EndEvent; ControlPointsItem->EndEvent. If emitEvent() fires all signals from ControlPointsItem too; the order of EndEvent being fired will switch. Not a huge deal; but can cause issues with UIs in some cases.

There doesn't seem to be an opposite method to remove the by-ref modifier. At the moment I've put a hack in place which re-builds the assembly-qualified name without an at the end of the type name and then loads that type; but this is horribly dirty...

God bless! Craig. (Now; how do I close this question again?)...
209,-1,But not how it's currently implemented. Instead the interwikimap should be consulted to see whether a interwiki link is local; and as soon as a non-local interwiki link is happening throwing this exception (but as InvalidTitle of course). How is en:meatball:Foo an invalid link? I've added that to the link tests and it's fine. And en:meatball:en:Foo doesn't work as the meatball wiki appears to have no interwiki map.

215,0,If you can use Cygwin; there is little point to needing to worry about a Windows scripting solution.
216,0,+1 for the patch.
217,-1,is it not by default ? if yes ; then it is really horrible...
218,1,thanks to Ernst Fastl for adding this.
219,0,That can't be expressed with a static suffix; but it's easily expressed with a regex.
220,0,Would it help to create a View in your database that excludes the blob; and then generate your dbml from the view? It's not too terribly different from your second option; but keeps the changes mainly in the database itself; without requiring any changes to your existing table structure.
221,0,here; bro: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/chrishays/archive/2004/10/27/centeredimages.aspx
222,-1,"I'm rethinking the design of my GUI. I designed a few JFrame with Netbeans automated GUI (yes; I'm lazy; and this generated code is often awful; I know !); but now I want them to be JPanel (actually; to inherit from another class that inherits JPanel). But I had the ""setDefaultCloseOperation"" modified; so my code is broken : setDefaultCloseOperation is impossible for a JPanel. Since I can't modify the generated code; I was wondering : is there a way to make Netbeans understand I changed my mind; and regenerate the code ?"
223,-1,That would suck.
224,-1,Is there a sensible way to group Long UTC dates by Day? I would Mod them by 86400 but that doesn't take leap seconds into account. Does anyone have any other ideas; I'm using java so I could parse them into Date Objects; but I'm a little worried of the performance overhead of using the date class. Also is there a more efficient way than comparing the year month and day parts of a Date object?
225,0,A title being edited will not show up in action=post-history.
226,1,There are many ways to do this; one way is: Followed by: In general; the SQLite project has really fantastic documentation! I know we often reach for Google before the docs; but in SQLite's case; the docs really are technical writing at its best. It's clean; clear and concise.
227,-1,This is how you find the arc length given the parameter; but finding equidistant points requires the inverse of this function. Getting from one to the other is not trivial. @Christian Romo: how did you do it? I mean; you can just use binary search; but that would be horribly slow (for what I'm trying to do; anyway).
228,-1,`Logger logger = new logger.getLogger` - I'd be more worried about the impending logpocalypse!
229,-1,Finally closing this bug from hell.
230,0,No you can't do that. MySQL doesn't know how to handle PHP scripts.
231,1,Excellent! @vinay-kr-sharma ; but i add some more code to put my month language
232,-1,I have a that has three views per cell; with three cell displaying on the view at one time (for a total of nine views). Think of it as a bookshelf. Sometimes I can have as many as 500 books. I've added shadow to the with code that is this: When I add the shadow code; as seen above; scrolling performance is just totally killed and becomes choppy. Each image has a different so the shadow has to be created for each item as it scrolls. Anyone have any tips on how to add shadows to my images on a without having this issue?
233,1,Hi Nick; Can you please re-create this patch as I can't get the code to compile?  For starters; I can't get the class AttributeImplItem to compile.  Please use the latest trunk when doing so Thanks.-- George
234,0,I would like to intercept the event in a .NET Windows Forms TabControl when the user has changed tab by double-clicking the tab (instead of just single-clicking it). Do you have any idea of how I can do that?
235,0,What about Signed zero. -0.0 vs Unsigned zero 0.0

244,0,Hibernate related maven conf.

246,1,Agreed. We will need to get this repo setup and populated before these changes are approved and applied on any hosts. Can anyone confirm if I have guessed an appropriate name for the repository?
247,-1,My bad.

253,0,Didn't we just do this a month ago?
254,-1,In the end the answer was - yes - indeed. It was simply a delay between me adding my google test account and it actually being recognised as such :@! Google should have a warning about this - in-app billing is a complete nightmare to code!
255,0,i think you really want a pthread_once_t here instead; unless i'm misunderstanding what you're trying to do.
256,0,I think the first approach is OK; but you have to be sure to always have branch B updated with the new changes introduced in branch A. Otherwise if you don't keep them synchronized; these branches will diverge and merging them back on trunk will be a really pain. SVN merge's are ok if you do them early and often.
257,0,trivial change to make the minSize be 1 byte.
258,1,It's great to see you've gotten the ball rolling Chris.
259,-1,I'm not sure what the problem is; but the behavior (at least in 0.1.4) is that the _isClosed AtomicBoolean is not being set to closed in a timely manner.
260,0,Yeah; can't cache KV. Can we have something for one server first?
261,0,I haven't fully grok'd the entire issue yet but have a quick comment: 2.0 was released several months ago...it's not 2.0-alpha-5-SNAPSHOT.
262,0,Maybe you could do the same that he did; i.e. explicitly declare rc05 version of Guava to force maven to use this one?
263,1,I am using LLBLGen Pro 2.5 with self-servicing. If I want to add some rows into my tables within a transaction and then update the first row I added; do I have to add that first entity into the transaction object again? Here is a fictional example of what I mean: Any advice would be greatly appreciated!
264,1,Thanks Erwan for you're effort :-)
265,0,Doh wait; I said what I thought it was and what it was in the previous patchset.  It seems wrong now?  This will insert an empty paragraph?
266,0,You should accept @Andreas Petersson's answer.
267,1,This might work for what I have in mind; will certainly give it a try.
268,0,How about an extension method that calls the actual () implementation? The only downside is you have to add . This works because the parameter (via ) infers a type for . As an alternative (if the is a pain); consider making it static; with an instance argument that is used primarily for type inference:
269,1,Great question!
270,0,Created an attachment (id=2473) Patch to MANIFEST.MF
271,0,The answer was devastatingly simple in this case. For some reason windows uses localhost as opposed to 0.0.0.0. So although it says standing watch at 0.0.0.0:4567 it is actually standing watch at localhost:4567 . You should be able to navigate to this page and see your middleman build.
272,-1,This is just syntax sugar over what Eugene wrote. I'm afraid that this generator could be very slow if grids are sufficiently large. After all; each yield still requires four index lookups.
273,0,How could I add FILE_NAME files into the CODE_FRAGMENT file??
274,-1,Why the down-votes and sniping? It's not a particularly well-asked question but it's certainly valid and by definition programming related. (it's pretty hard to do anything with Django without programming as it's a web programming framework!)
275,1,Ohhh. I have a white background; so I didn't catch the yellow highlight. Thanks!

285,1,Excellent answer; thanks! Wish I could give you more points.
286,-1,I always get the same stupid error.

288,0,+1 I committed this.
289,-1,Your are really violating the idea of TDD if your code if doing something different for the Test. Why do you only need to change it inside the test?
290,0,should be \'s you can tell my preferred environment....
291,-1,I would suggest FlexUnit for automated testing of libraries you're building but it is a serious pain to use for a full application.
292,1,I actually fear that PHP accepts this due to some easteregg or so :)
293,1,Thanks; Myrna.
294,0,Ok I'll add these.
295,-1,I think that you have a problem described in this bug report.

299,0,Closing all resolved tickets from 2010 or older
300,0,Yes; I reviewed the whole file and only identified this one.
301,0,I can't seem to find the answer to this anywhere... I have a function that needs to set the bg color of two tables. Only the first table in the function is being affected. Is only one for loop allowed in a function? ...or is the 1st for loop maybe never exiting? I can pretty much work around this by creating multiple functions but I really want to understand why this behaves the way it does! Thanks! Here is my simplified code:
302,0,The include won't become redundant as the macros will still be needed. Instead the replicated Check{C;CXX}CompilerFlag.cmake will become redundant.
303,0,@Pax; from my personal experience; somehow I always get faster and more reliable results when I'm using tables. But every time I did that; I feel guilty.
304,0,we will need to log the error since it is ignored by caller
305,0,Use CDI's CODE_FRAGMENT with CODE_FRAGMENT or JSF's CODE_FRAGMENT with CODE_FRAGMENT.
306,0,Actually it seems to be line 21 that is indented wrong.  The newly added lines are correctly indented inside the <ui:style> tag.
307,0,Yeah it helps; though I was more questioning whether there's not already a boolean that keeps track of this; but apparently not.
308,0,I'm a complete newbie to C++. Can somebody explain to me how this works?
309,0,change status from ASSIGNED to NEW for consistency
310,-1,That is what is causing your null pointer exception.
311,0,Why is it returning the list of children both in the return type and in the argument type ? The signature should be GetChildren() const. Since getting the children shouldn't result in a modification of this node.
312,-1,Not sure about this method. It seems to make sense to me the way Dan explained it but I'm not comfortable giving this change a +2 since I didn't write any of the original code and may not be aware of all of the issues.
313,0,Sort of - :
314,0,Usually unbuffered is limited to four ranks per channel; but most boards I have seen can take either unbuff'd or reg'd. From what you've been describing; I think devicetree.cb is a more optimal answer. (You'll hear me say that a lot. sorry)
315,0,Used AccountCache. It feels a bit weird that if we do a bulk load we have no way of setting the results on AccountCache. Perhaps that class should be extended so bulk loading is faster; but that is beyond this change. (Slight aside; Guava caches don't have any first-class bulk loading functionality; sadly.)
316,0,That's why I have posted my last patch.
317,1,The maintainers' rationale is covered in the JSF specification.
318,0,"Using a unique identifiers would allow you to merge data from two different databases. Maybe you have an application that collects data in multiple database and then ""syncs"" with a master database at various times in the day. You wouldn't have to worry about primary key collisions in this scenario. Or; possibly; you might want to know what a record's ID will be before you actually create it."

342,0,if you called it port_mirroring in schema; why nic.portMirroring?
343,-1,Hmm notification sounds like a QObject::signals; I'd say that's somewhat misleading. So I'd name that with something indicating the progress Bar.
344,-1,Is this visual studio specific or all c++ projects behave this way? Why??
345,0,I'll take a look at this for the next release (after 1.5.11).
346,0,not cross platform
347,1,is a really great option for git. Most of the free; public hosting sights will insist that you license your code with an OSS license (and; possibly; your documentation). That's potentially a different thing that you're talking about (backups). For just backups; you may want to try a for-pay service or even something like .

358,0,If string object allocations worry you; then you should precompile the regular expression!
359,0,It's feeling funky and not particularly DRY in here.  Do you think we should have a more consolidated response handler; then have these functions simply access already processed data?
360,-1,Sorry; https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=514760 is related but not same.
361,-1,You are mixing two different use cases. Use case 1:  beginTransaction() commit()  this works; because beginTransaction() set autoCommit=false and commit is successful even though nothing to commit.  Use case 2:  open Connection with autoCommit=true commit()  Evidently; this doesn't work on all Jdbc dialects supported by Gerrit. E. g. this doesn't work on PostgreSQL for the same reason why rollback() doesn't work. To see the failure; remove this if-guard above and run PostgreSQL unit test:  testRollbackNoTransaction()  it is failing with:  Cannot commit when autoCommit is enabled.  or some such.

366,-1,That's really sad...
367,0,The director wasn't being accessed here; but in getSubstitutionsPaths() which had such a check. I duplicated the check as it makes it more obvious.
368,0,Yes; bytes + comparator would work fine for jaql.  Preferably; it would be the same comparators that are already used by the sort code; which work on serialized bytes (but also on WritableComparables; so that might be a problem).  If these comparators are inconsistent; then the sort in map/reduce will not work properly.  I think it is ok to document the transitivity requirement; but I don't see how you can enforce it in any way.  Different key types are fine; as long as the comparator knows how to handle them.  If you can't reuse the same comparator interface; I can always implement my comparisons in another place; but I already have two of them (one in the WritableComparable; and one in the Comparator). I don't see how column families and the key comparator are related; except that they are both table-level metadata. Yes; I agree that a single comparator would be used for the entire table.
369,-1,yes I'm having the exact same issue; very annoying!

376,1,+1 patch looks good.
377,1,Here's the official API on Java CODE_FRAGMENT; useful for quantifier syntax.
378,-1,Aye; the timer idea would result in horrible flickering for sure!
379,1,That is great - it also means you can move that line outside of the if/else. You also need another in6_addr: you have to have both dest and gateway (though for default and host you only use one or the other).  Same is needed in the v4 case.

390,1,So through an incredibly awesome coding session I managed to extract all the variables on the first try. Well; all checked out except for array since the PDF I tested on didn't have one in the Aux Info. All the data from CGPDFDictionaryRef are now in an NSMutableDictionary; so its usable. Tomorrow I'll be making the second part to put it back into the other type that is needed; CFDictionaryRef. So if you wanted to wait I'll post it up.

399,-1,I'm afraid you're wrong.
400,0,Matt; what's the cut-off date for providing a patch?
401,1,No it doesn't. We just have to parse repo-hooks childNodes after the project childNodes. Which you already do above. :-)
402,-1,However; I figured it was better to get it in the public domain sooner and let the iterative process do it's work.
403,0,"style-nit: I think spaces around ""+"" are preferred in Gerrit's code base."

406,-1,Back in the day I had to solve this with a panel where the text box is a component inside and had DockPadding set to 3 or 4 pixels. I'd then style that panel to a single pixel. I always found this really annoying!
407,0,Not really; no. I basically just took JaredPar's word for it that the threadID would be reasonably stable; used this during testing; and then changed the interface to react to OnMouseMove events instead for the final deployment. I didn't do that originally because it means passing events up through a whole chain of Controls and is generally just a pain in the ass. It is; however; more reliable than the above method; which only failed once or twice during the whole of testing; but did fail.
408,-1,Do not remove the entire statement; SeekGroup() has side effects.

419,0,bq.In order to maintain different states at which we are in while creating table should we go for a special node under the table znode or can we add new states to the existing table states like (DISABLING; ENABLING; DISABLED etc) IMO go with separate node.
420,1,Thank you for the source code; but why don't you also attach a diff file you get by running 'svn diff'?  It will help us figure out which part is changed exactly.  Thanks in advance! Your idea sounds very good; though. :D

Due to legacy databases also on the server I am targeting; I am not able to re-configure the default connection settings as is quite rightly stated in the accepted answer in . My question is: How do you convince LinqToSQL to run a SQL before executing an update?
426,0,The framework is incomplete without it.
427,0,I'd prefer create lost-found/MDTxxxx dir in the way client does; that is MDT0 alloc fid from MDTxxxx and create this dir like a normal mkdir. Though a sequence may be used only for this fid only; but this mechanism can be used in the future for similar case that MDT0 wants to create remote directory.

448,1,Hi Ivan;  {quote} + long numberOfEntriesToReplicate = lastEntryId - firstEntryId; should be (lastEntryId - firstEntryId) + 1 {quote} You are right; both side entries has to be considered. Thank a lot for noticing it.  {quote} In general; I think this splitting should be in LedgerFragmentReplicator; rather than BookKeeperAdmin. This way you could avoid the need to expose the update of ledger metadata. It will make control flow a little more complex as you'll have to initiate replication on the next subfragment from the callback of the current; but i think it would encapsulate things a bit better. {quote} Yes; in general; all the split logic should be in LFR. I might pushed that code to BKAdmin because; I don't want to disturb admin key flow much; which will go through LFR. Now anyway; I moved that logic; still not disturbing BKAdmin key flows in anyway.  Attached a patch; which addresses the comments.  Also to give more confidence on split fragment scenarios; I have added multiple boundary cases for FragmentSplit.  Thanks a lot; Ivan for your nice reviews!

461,-1,Hi Lars; sorry about the delay in responding. Good point about the TreeMap always returning result in a deterministic ordering. The patch itself I think is still beneficial because it removes a little bit of redundancy in the existing equality code. IMO; the fix makes it easier to understand as well. In addition; the tests are beneficial since we were missing coverage there. I think it'd be better if the fix were in sooner; but it's probably not an issue if we moved it to 0.94.7.

472,0,"But then there's no need to re-define the gwt-maven-plugin's dependencies. So either we use ${gwtVersion} as the gwt-maven-plugin version and we remove the plugin dependencies; or we keep it that way; with identical but ""unrelated"" versions for GWT and the gwt-maven-plugin. I'd happily go with the former (which would simplify the POM and aligns with what people should write unless they really need different versions of GWT and the plugin √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú e.g. they use a patched GWT; or a patched plugin; or the plugin hasn't yet been released for the version of GWT they want to use; or the plugin has had a bugfix release); but it makes it a bit harder to test the WebAppCreator with a GWT RC (not yet pushed to Central); where the plugin hasn't yet been released (because it cannot update its GWT dependencies yet).

479,-1,Hello;  Sure you are right here; I didn't make myself clear enough Im sorry.  As you (and RFC959) say; when we are sending the file we should transform to NVT-ASCII but not when we are receiving the file. In this second case; i think that the expected behaviour is that the text message be written to a file with the default line separator for the platform.  The sender converts the data from an internal character representation to the standard 8-bit NVT-ASCII representation (see the Telnet specification).  The receiver will convert the data from the standard form to his own internal form.   Actually ; according to the spec before a RETR ASCII operation is transformed we should be converting the charset to ASCII ; for our machine could be using EBCDIC  to store files and clients are supposed to expect that files are encoded in NVT-ASCII.  So I don't know ... Any way; this has little priority for me (until someone using a non-ascii-compatible encoding complains) so we could leave this for the future. Any way I don't like ASCII mode for it breaks  the 'REST' command. My implementation only supports binary mode.

531,0,I just started practicing TDD in my projects. I'm developing a project now using php/zend/mysql and phpunit/dbunit for testing. I'm just a bit distracted on the idea of encapsulation and the test driven approach. My idea behind encapsulation is to hide access to several object functionalities. To make it more clear; private and protected functions are not directly testable(unless you will create a public function to call it). So I end up converting some private and protected functions to public functions just to be able to test them. I'm really violating the principles of encapsulation to give way to micro function testability. Is this the correct way of doing it?

As soon as I have more than 1 server; there is the obvious problem where the socket.io connections need to be shared between the servers. This is where you'd normally use the redis store plugin that comes with socket.io. Unfortunately; I use MongoDB (not redis); and the cost of adding another database to my stack would be prohibitively high. I tried using the module; but it absolutely killed my servers (huge CPU usage). Is there any other way to share the socket.io session between EC2 servers?

633,1,I made a template in my wiki called Template:quote; which contains the following content: Then I can use the template in a page; e.g.; {{quote|a little test}} Works pretty well - Thanks!
634,-1,Visual studio crashes as soon as I open aspx or ascx View from MVC 2.0 project. If I delete all bin and obj folders from projects; I can open aspx and ascx View page. But it crashes again after compiling. It started to crash after I moved strong typed model to different project. I got stuck and cannot go further; really frustrated! I'm using Visual staudio 2008 Sp1. MVC 2.0; Window xp sp3. .NET 3.5 sp1. Anyone can help?
635,0,Are you saying Segoe UI is your windows font?
636,0,#NAME?
637,0,Committed to HDFS-3042 branch.
638,0,I'm trying to conditionally hook this into the build so we can get it into SVN and go from there
639,0,Any ideas? 
640,1,Hi Edward Thanks for spotting it.
641,0,I'm looking for some open source alternative to create reports from classic asp they don't have to be something awfully elaborated; we rather find some simple product that allows us to generate pdf files from a data set. we were thinking about developing some kind of service that took an xml as input and returned a pdf; probably with jasperreports or any other free tool... we also looked for a component that could convert plain html to pdf; adding some special tags to handle pagination and layout... any idea?
642,1,Good ideas; thanks Alexey. I've updated the test patch.

644,-1,I have a query that has approx 20 columns and I would like to export this to an Excel file with the column headers. I thought this would be easy to figure out but no luck! I searched the web and found one suggestion that did not end up working so I am stuck. Anyone have any working ideas? Thanks;
645,0,What platform? What languages will you accept?
646,0,Okay Edward; you haven't understood how it works.
647,0,Do you think you can make us a minimal test case which demonstrates the problem?
648,-1,How come there is change for IO resources with config option of 64BIT_PREF_MEM ?
649,1,You can use Gson library ( or any other ) to parse the json object FILE_NAME object.
650,0,In this situation; when I click on the greyed out widget; I need to start the app.
651,-1,"To my limited knowledge; in Android; any activity must belong to a given process. However; the book says: "" The activity life cycle is not tied to the process life cycle."" that is to say; even if the process has been completely killed; its activities can still be alive! What makes me confused is: Because the input handlers of an activity are bound to the process. If the process has been killed; how do its activities react to the user's inputs?"
652,0,Also; make sure the mouse is using VMware drivers. Sometimes it reverts to general PS/2 drivers; which can cause very irritating lag.
653,0,heuristics should check tvb_captured_length first to make sure there is enough data to run the heuristic; otherwise it might throw an exception just checking; and prevent subsequent heuristics from claiming the packet appropriately
654,0,whereas on non-daylight savings change day we see.
655,0,I did not write it in a way that fits in with the rest of the implementations though.
656,-1,I tried the following and it returns nothing.
657,1,This project looks very promising - thanks!
658,1,As mentioned above; some of the fundamental Object Oriented Design principles are OCP; LSP; DIP and ISP. An excellent overview of these by Robert C. Martin (of Object Mentor) is available here:
659,0,I did that first; but then remembered that when I did that in the past; people were unable to apply my patches; w/o doing the svn move themselves.
660,1,I answered the same question . Best of luck! As you will see; I like the tools.
661,1,+1; patch looks good.
662,0,It has been applied to the trunk.
663,0,"it will be ""group 01"" according to the group created earlier but also there is a problem in the fact that the string we are looking for has quotes in it as well. Maybe use a single quote for wrapping the string"
664,1,The effect I believe you are seeking is achieved by providing a HeaderTemplate for the TabItem's in you Tab collection. Hope this helps!
665,1,+1  Jihoon; Thank you for your contribution.  Sergio; Thank you for your review. 
666,0,0
667,0,I think not; we implementing it because we need it; so it should be optional.
668,1,Regex is your friend.
669,0,It would probably also be worth having optimized versions for primitive values; instead of writing them to an Avro/Writable first to get the bytes representation.
670,0,@ 1.
671,0,Not unless your Java framework is horribly inefficient; or for apps in which the db server does 99% of the work.
672,0,@Owen - I'm working on getting Harmony working on Hadoop at present. We're pretty close; and have workarounds for most issues but the trick is to fix the issues in such a way that we can create a patch with a resolution that works for all the JREs. Yes;
673,0,It means 2-bytes per symbol in most case.
674,1,Are we on the good path...
675,1,It will be great if you could confirm it either way first.
676,0,As KeywordTokenizer does the same thing; I'll close this issue.
677,-1,Pull it back in if you think different.
678,1,Great question bud!
679,1,I've just been looking at php's autoload() function. Seems a nice idea; but I'm not sure how it handles multiple directories. My current development basically has a library directory structure grouping classes into subdirectories by operation. I'm wondering I have to declare a include() for each directory ... which I really hope I don't have to do. Can you advise - thanks
680,1,+1 on intent from looking at what the patch fixes.
681,-1,"no need to be redundant ""described in the report"". but this is bogus anyway - commit message are expected to be self-contained; and the bug links are merely ""for more info; see ..."" style."
682,0,Are you really sure you need to use a cursor? Those are not supposed to be the first choice in SQL Server these days. In fact; many experts abhor them.
683,0,That tests if the highest bit in a 32 bit integer is set; not what was required.
684,1,"I've added to my answer to show a ""code once and still be scalable"" way of defining your font sizes. Good luck with your project!"
685,1,That's terrific; thank you!
686,-1,HOLY SHIT!
687,-1,@CarlNorum: That would be extremely annoying; given that the above is well-defined C89...
688,0,Partition it first; to divide the zeros from the non-zeros. Then sort the rest. Oh; and before worrying about that; profile first!
689,1,Megan; Glad to be of service : )
690,-1,@NoBugs a NullPointerException can be thrown for 1000 reasons. Are you sure you load the .wav correctly? Are you sure it is in the right path? IIRC; the .wav file should be inside the compiled jar. Although I might be terribly wrong.
691,-1,Damn !
692,-1,Evaluation of what? I may be being slow today; but I really don't understand what your problem is. I'm awful tempted to vote to close on the principle that I don't see a real question.
693,0,Ok.
694,0,I don't think we have parent indexed.  So you'll need to add it to the index_*.sql files; and also do a schema change to add an index on this column.
695,0,Also; you might find that being able to cast our variables makes working with events in Dart bliss.
696,0,if we assume that initCache() always succeeds - otherwise service constructor fails - we do not need to check for non-nil cache or return error for it anywhere
697,1,@prototypical - Absolutely. I was never to solve this xTo-1 issue and ended up creating mirror images for my sprites. I praised the genius who created keyboard shortcuts that day!
698,0,This means; that every time you will operate on the exact same object; that was originally injected on start.
699,0,You may want to check for NULL because cbmem allocations can fail.
700,1,Would you please try the patch? Thanks very much!
701,1,I'd be interested to hear how this works out. You are very brave :)
702,-1,Currently the msbuild logs for team build are appalling as they are just plain text and are very difficult to read. Also the ones created by my build are approx 30Mb and take quite a while to download (our TFS server is in our datacentre). Does anyone know any way of being able to view these logs easier; prefereably integrated with either TFS itself or TFS WebAccess?
703,1,@mludd: excellent!
704,0,This looks like it might be a blocker for release.
705,-1,Who made this stupid rule?
706,0,So my question now is.
707,-1,And debugging is hell; because the test environment needs to have the exact same loader setup.
708,0,As far as I understand the specification; [/jcr:system/jcr:versionStorage/17/66/ea/1766eaef-f0f5-4cf6-95ef-a1d7290257f9] is not a legal name:  http://www.day.com/specs/jcr/2.0/6_Query.html#6.7.4 Name  Name ::= '[' quotedName ']' | '[' simpleName ']' | simpleName ::= /* A JCR Name that is also a legal SQL identifier 10 */ 10 See the SQL:92 rules for <regular identifier> (in ISO/IEC 9075:1992 ¬ß5.2 <token> and <separator>).   
709,0,My goal here is a very small/quick change to revert how every FsShell command (except count) to how it used to work.
710,-1,I would guess it is doing basic sanity checking (i.e. should anything have changed) - to prevent unexpected source code changes (I hate it when opening a file can cause side-effects - I'm looking at you; DBML!). On a side note; to force serialization generally (I don't think it will apply due to the above): the and are a convention used by the framework.
711,0,The package gets deleted in the registry.
712,0,This is a solution to a local problem; not an obvious/general purpose System.String operation. A utility class might be in order; but it would be extension method abuse to use an extension method here.
713,0,I am running the program as a Java Application.
714,0,"Split out some fixes to the SSTII bytes tracker getting out of sync w/ the underlying stream; and did some cleanup to make the streamed/file versions less divergent.  Also adds parallel compaction testing to LazilyCompactedRowTest.  CliTest and DefsTest generate compaction loads (in DefsTest's case; on the Migrations CF -- haven't dug into CliTest as much) that break w/ parallel enabled; although the test doesn't actually fail (argh).  Haven't figured out what's causing that; and haven't come up with a way to reproduce in a ""real"" test yet.  The DefsTest does mix lazy/nonlazy iteration in the merge; which may be relevant.  bq. I'm also no proposing to complicate things.  You're right; poor choice of words on my part.  Latest gives the merge executor a SynchronousQueue.  I think that's a better way to cut worst-case; than the Deserializer; for the reason given previously.  bq. 'if...instanceof' business is a bit error prone/ugly  Agreed.

The bytesRead ""race"" should also be fixed in CompactionIterable  done  bq. I would have put the code in CompactedRow.close() at the end of the LCR.write() instead of adding a new method; as it avoids forgetting calling close  I did consider that; but it feels weird to me to have write implicitly call close.  I guess we could just change the method name? :)  bq. We can make PreCompactedRow.removeDeletedAndOldShards a public method and use it in PCI.MergeTask  done"
715,0,I believe this is a duplicate of HTTPCORE-328 Oleg
716,0,Committed revision 1142583. I also plan to backport the fix to the 10.8 branch.
717,1,I really like Kate; and since it's a KPart; other KDE programs use it as the editor; so it's goodness everywhere! (why is everybody else assuming you use windows?)
718,0,However; HBASE-4087 is required for the new unit test to pass.
719,0,Can you help in understanding this code.
720,0,There are 3 things you can do.
721,0,Is there a way to fetch a pull request?
722,0,Hi; I have changed the rsync to rsync.eu.apache.org.
723,0,Thanks.
724,-1,Mac; looks like the tests are failing (especially TestHarFileSystem).
725,-1,Couldn't this be simplified inline to rebalance_completed () ? Please note rebalance_completed has a bug; you should only check for 'completed' status instead of inversing for 'in progress'.
726,0,Soundararajan; Ning - Yes I am planning on working on it starting next week.
727,0,You can try this one: WEB_ADDRESS.

737,0,There's no actual need to have this routine similar to how it's done in bit-rot-scrub.c since there just one (1) option to reconfigure. Keep it simple and just do a GF_OPTION_{INIT;RECONF} in the appropriate function.
738,1,I have committed this.  Thanks; Junping!
739,0,i have found out that i have to read the error log.
740,0,The last thing you should be worrying about is how fast one of these is. There is no way that checking a string for being an integer is going to be a bottleneck in your code.

744,0,Right; and right after that is the section I was referring to.
745,0,Hmmm... it's not collisions then; it was worth a try.
746,-1,I'm an idiot... there's nothing wrong with the readme.txt.
747,0,"A generic ""Sum"" method would be a simple example. T Sum(IEnumerable sequence)"
748,0,No. I must have missed it while removing things. I'll update the patch to nix this.
749,1,It would be helpful if the returned structure were described more fully; just for clarity.
750,1,I recently imported about 60k records into a table that relates data in one table to data in another table. However; my client has since requested that a sort order be added to all 60k records. My hope is there is a nice clean way to auto generate these sort orders in a SQL Update. The finished data should look something like this: Can this be done? Any suggestions would be hugely appreciated. --Anne

760,0,I guess this change (New) will be handled in a separate patch...
761,-1,It seems very tedious! I have a nine table join to join together; where two of the tables is a inner join and the rest 6 is left outer joins. Is it doable in entity?
762,0,Fixing this issue led to the next issue.
763,1,Thanks; Ashish!
764,-1,Sorry; should have commented on this much sooner.
765,0,Thanks for the patch Glen.

768,1,@R.. Wow! Really great answer!! You should post it as an answer here; as it's really more precise. Just a question; though; when you say round for the alignment of the type; you mean that if for example on your example you had a short b instead of int b;

771,-1,Not an exact answer I'm afraid; but this information might help.
772,0,Fixed TestCompositeService to not depend on test-order and thus made it pass on JDK7.
773,0,Is that true?
774,-1,I don't think the comparison with the SshCommands (or RestViews) is fair. For SSH commands we have a simple lookup by command name and it is all that matters. For project rename tasks it may be (and probably is) critical in which order the steps are executed. It is not just a set of tasks that can be done in any order. For a critical command as project rename the order of tasks execution should be explicit. At least it has to be documented. Right now; one has to look in the TaskModule; then in the DynamicSet and find out that; internally; it stores its items in a list which means that the iterator() will iterate in the order of the elements as they are in this list. And this is not even documented/guaranteed behavior of the DynamicSet.
775,0,You can pass in -ret as errno to gf_msg. Also; this can be a new msgid : DHT_MSG_OPEN_FD_ON_DST_FAILED

791,-1,I cannot seem to figure out why the phpunit target does not output any test results even though I have tests in position. The problem I am finding is there is no indication as to what the problem is! Incredibly frustrating. The output is as follows: My build.xml is as follows: My system: Vista; PHP 5.2.9; PHPUnit 3.4; PHPUnderControl; CruiseControl
792,0,I need the page to include the sitemap because I'm saving context from each of the three previous pages. That way the user can click the previous page in the sitemap; and it will load the data I stored (i.e. load the data from their previous search).
793,0,I did nothing special. My understanding was that simply trying to test under JDeveloper caused the problem. Your report says removing xmlparserv2 causes JDeveloper not to start.  Is there something else I need to do to cause the problem? FYI - I created a Maven project with the code above as the only application. I then imported the application; which was a bit frustrating as it didn't seem to accomplish much. I then had to manually add the log4j 2 jars into the classpath along with target/classes and had to make a couple of other changes so that it knew how things were laid out in the project. I then ran the application from JDeveloper and it ran fine.
794,1,Thanks! This looks very promising!
795,0,The absolut portion of the path *is always prepended*.
796,0,This is a workaround for WDDM that does not belong here. IMO it would be best split out into a separate commit so that there is a clear record of it. Additionally; has this been tested thoroughly?
797,0,You need to encapsulate the regex pattern in quotes.
798,0,do we need to take care all of this; if we decide not to put them in 2.0 ?

804,1,Thanks Nat. The external data is large (external search results) so it's not possible to keep it as a new list. We're a SharePoint plugin so I can't guarantee that the BDC will be available at all installations. I guess I'm kind of out of luck with your suggestions but I appreciate the answer!
805,0,Will try and do so within the next couple of days unless [~bikassaha] or [~sseth] beat me to it.
806,0,Might be better to move this test to right after the docio_read_doc_key_meta call; since it's doing the error handling for it. If there was an error; there's no point in populating 'doc' and '*doc_offset'; right?
807,1,Excellent answer! Your recipe works like a charm.
808,-1,Sorry; I'll clarify my answer as to what I mean by desktop Flash. Is the issue here that you want to impose limits; or you're afraid you'll exceed them? Or just checking whether there are any?
809,0,This can probably be removed if the suggestions for performOk and performApply are implemented.

We are started with in few places; But now we found an issue that it does not work if the flash player not installed in the browser. Its working only after installed the flash player in browser. This is really worrying. We should not force user to install flash player to upload images/video. How to handle this issue?

831,-1,It's a terrible idea to include a using directive in a header file too. This simply mitigates that problem.
832,0,This is a screenshot from 1.5.3 and that is how I would expect the Directory Studio to behave.
833,-1,The CherryPick RESTApi acts on revisions (e.g. patchsets); not Changes. Just like the review RestApi does. Hence I don't think that it should go into ChangeApi. Look at the REST-url; and you will see it differs quite from the other RESTFul commands in ChangeApi. If you still want me to add it to ChangeApi; I can do that. But this is how I reasoned about where to put it.

843,1,whoops; this is not new code; but docs are always good!
844,-1,I have no idea what this means; but this is probably not the place to fix it!
845,0,{quote} I fail to see why that is a bad thing if we're looking at the rare scenario of having to postpone the sorting decision to search time.
846,0,In that agent I can get an inputstream on the font file using this code.
847,1,I am learning ML. Can some one please help me out with basic input/output functions in ML?? I just want to read input from console and store it in a variable and use it in my ML program. Please help. If you can point me towards some example for this also it would be super great!!! Thank you.
848,1,I really enjoy using Beanstalk too. I few days ago I realized an iPhone app to get access to your account info on your iPhone; this is the iTunes link: Best! Pablo
849,0,> So at very least you should only check/parse patch set part; if ref starts with REFS_CHANGES; if at all. It already does this; startIndex checks for the prefix.
850,1,"Tying this to --invisible is not correct. With --invisible there is no UI; so collaboration would be quite challenging ;-) I think with a proper Listen/Unlisten implementation we do not need a command line option at all; or do we? A ""listen always"" option instead should go into the user configuration at the end; IMHO."
851,-1,There is no VDSM action here; only database - just make the command transactive; and save yourself all this hassle.

853,0,E.g. I get an array of CODE_FRAGMENT objects.
854,0,Maybe we should purge the Reader+queuing step and just have Handlers do the read (Nicolas Liochon what you think?)

856,0,This bug was introduced by https://issues.apache.org/struts/browse/WW-2171
857,0,Just that they make you list the type twice. i.e. List list = new ArrayList()
858,0,I made a preliminary patch to share the idea how this can be fixed.
859,1,Marcelo; thanks for pointing out this; it is now fixed in rev.
860,0,So yes; you need to keep track of the position yourself.
861,1,I just committed this. Thanks; Amareshwari!
862,-1,Ok here is a patch that works. I was stupid enough not to see it...
863,0,I guess the big question is whether it is sufficient to test the functionality by mocking out getaddrinfo() or if we need to actually make the call. If the former; I think it could go in UT. Lets see what others' say.
864,0,Yes; just made the same observation.
865,0,A few months ago the Coding Horror blog reported on some platform with an atrociously bad sorting algorithm. If you have to use that platform then you sure do want to implement your own instead.
866,-1,This is extremely ugly C-style code; easy to get wrong. While the bugs in your code have been fixed by earlier birds; here is the C++ way to do this:

871,0,No issue found after noting how it's invoked.
872,0,NativeFileSystemView represents the underlying OS file system view - no more no less.
873,0,Hmm; wouldn't it make sense to prefer to close READ file handles first?  Then; if the client is still writing it will have the correct handle.the client can read on a file opened for write; but not the reverse.
874,0,Sounds like it should be disabled. It is reasonable to run a whole multi-sim workflow (em; equil phases; simulate) in the same set of multi-dirs; so being able to use mdrun_mpi -multidir the-dirs* -deffnm equil-npt would be a nice thing. I haven't tried -multidir with a non-default equil-npt that I remember though. Should we be looking at doing the directory change for -multidir earlier than we do?
875,1,Yep; StackOverflow is written in C#/ .NET and is a very successful example of a high-scale site.
876,1,I have committed this.  Thanks; Rodrigo!
877,0,This patch looks pretty good.
878,0,That would take care of most cases.
879,0,bq. I did hit the error while I did that but I will verify again. Ugh.  If that's the case then maybe catch the OOM in the read; and fallback to the temp buffer read solution?
880,0,Any; but Solaris especially loves threads.
881,0,It uses a parallel benchmark that roughly models what our real-life benchmark is like.
882,1,Too awesome! This actually answered an unasked question of mine; how to stop people from cutting off others in my corporate meeting.
883,0,Ah - i jumped the gun on you.
884,0,The above solution works; but not for the latest version of Gradle.
885,0,Patch that adds the fix to WebResponse
886,1,Hi Mehdi; you are right. I am very sorry - I have misinterpreted the deviceRuntimeVersion as the version of DeviceRuntimeOnHostMachine.
887,0,Look forward to seeing it resolved in 3.3.2.GA!
888,0,You could easily test if it is due to felix by switching to equinox; if the effects are still there blame it on pax web or dosgi.

896,1,Nice!  Thanks for adding nice debug logging; too :-)

913,1,I am designing a contact form which has a 'Thank you' message pop up on send; I need my thank you message to be positioned relative; other wise if the user happens to scroll while the animation is running the message remains stuck in place and ruins the animation. However positing the div relative keeps it in the position before it loads; what I need is a way to have the div display:none or opacity:0 BEFORE the send button is pressed; is that possible? Here is an to explain what I'm trying to achieve a little better And below is the Javascript I'm using Any help would be really appreciated :) Thanks guys!

941,1,Thanks Tom!
942,-1,Enumerating all partitions of a set is . Now; all permutations of all partitions of a set will be ; although the example is a bit artificial. Now; to come up with a useful algorithm it's a totally different story. I am not aware of any such algorithm; and in any case its scaling will be absolutely awful.
943,1,Oh! Excellent!! Worked like a charm!
944,1,+1 patch looks good.
945,0,Since this script will go in ITK's tree and not the hooks; it should be licensed as the rest of ITK (which will soon be Apache but is not yet AFAIK).  Besides; the rest of the Apache license infrastructure (LICENSE and NOTICE) is not present yet.  Also; we should assign the copyright to the Insight Software Consortium for code going in ITK proper.

979,0,Should the output of this filter always be Real? This cast seems like is should be done outside this filter. If it's required it may be able to be done in-place for some situations.

Secondly; your cyrill check did not seem to be correct. Still; I am not used to cyrillic letters and I should be careful before I judge ;) hope it helps!

If a user has 50 items in their dashboard; which many do; this will take quite a few round-trips (13!) to completely load the status codes.  Worse; if the user navigates away before they are completely done loading; they will continue to load; as there is no way to cancel the queued RPCs. I would prefer having myApprovals and strongestApprovals take a Set<Change.Id> and return a Map<Change.Id; Whatever>; and make only one call to each method for the dashboard.

1201,1,Sumeet; we did it purposely because if the proxy services are dynamically loaded then we need to build those services at the runtime and redeploy them which is a little bit risky on a production environment. Also there is no mechanism to check whether a particular proxy definition is updated in the registry or not because this configuration is used only at the startup. We can add this functionality to load the proxy services only at the startup time from the registry (this doesn't mean they are dynamic); but I don't see any value there. If you could explain a bit about your exact requirement; I might be able to provide an alternative to this. Thanks; Ruwan

1262,0,Fixed the crash in this bug; let's open a new one for the SPDY connection issues.
1263,0,I saw you added a comment at https://review.openstack.org/#/c/138310/1/specs/kilo/store-capabilities.rst ; I think you probably already know the reason of this; right?
1264,1,"Patch looks mostly good to me. One comment: I think the name ""moveAndDeleteLocalFiles"" isn't quite descriptive enough. Perhaps ""asyncDeletePathOnEachVolume"" or something? The fact that the path is relative to *all* volumes and will be deleted on each of them is the key part I didn't understand at the first pass through the JIRA. I agree with Vinod that it would be nice to share code with CleanupQueue; but would be fine seeing it in another JIRA."
1265,-1,I'm not entering bogus reports for the hell of it ;) Matt
1266,0,Test cases for geomultidist() function. Add this and SOLR.2155.p3.patch
1267,0,Patch adds javadoc for the newly added tests.
1268,1,I've just committed this to trunk and branch-2. Thanks a lot for the reviews/testing; Chris and Todd.
1269,0,Could you attach a test case (Junit preferrably) that shows the unexpected behaviour?
1270,0,Committed revision 1058592. thanks uwe for the review
1271,0,Yes; I will open a new jira for this sometimes :)
1272,1,Thanks Doug for the change.
1273,0,Thanks Ivan; I commit the code according to your suggestion.
1274,1,I have exactly the same issue and am extremely interested in whether you found any solution.
1275,0,First; an attempt is made to convert       * each argument.
1276,0,Not sure when it was added.
1277,0,The following page has several implementations of general purpose hash functions that are efficient and exhibit minimal collisions: http://partow.net/programming/hashfunctions/index.html
1278,0,Therefore; it can no longer be used.
1279,0,What happens if a thread is interrupted multiple times by different threads?
1280,-1,Hi I'm using the chrome inspector (F12) to try and analyze the z-index of a twitter bootstrap popover; and finding it extremely frustrating... Is there a way to freeze the popover (while shown) so that I can assess and modify the associated CSS? Placing a fixed 'hover' on the associated link does not cause the popover to appear.
1281,-1,Why did you add this back? It's not needed as far as I know.
1282,0,same path as ZOOKEEPER-794_4.patch.txt but strip the path prefix added by Git.
1283,0,Edit: Thank you everyone for the help!
1284,0,But the question is not as simple as assuming ... . But surely this is a Google for it question? Pretty much every regex primer you can find anywhere uses IP as an example! scores 183;000 hits!
1285,1,I love it when I find the answer to my question without having to ask - thanks for running into the same question I had and helping me work through my issues!
1286,0,m->total_size is untrusted input; whereas c and microcode end are trusted. There's no risk of overflow.
1287,0,did you get the answer you were looking for?
1288,-1,I lost the whole morning cause HBase's RegionServer was dying with no logs; no nothing... how Am I supposed to debug the issue if u do not even generate a core dump?
1289,0,I guess above versioning should be updated since API changed
1290,0,has an
1291,0,Is this possible?
1292,0,Committed to trunk 1384014
1293,0,Starting with the socket IO; since Java 7 the NIO API has been available; which means you can leave the threading required to prevent blocking the main thread to the OS.
1294,1,I solved this need by using . I am able to route calls from Edge to my local machine. Absolutely love ngork! :-)
1295,0,I would expect a comment saying that we want to fall through whenever we fall through.
1296,-1,Poor Steve just got screwed over by people not reading what he wrote correctly. I hate it when that happens; but I can understand why they read it the way they did. You left the statement rather ambiguous.
1297,1,try it out very helpful; loved it n its easy to use
1298,-1,Since ChangeSets are becoming too many to handle because of many checkins; I'm thinking of selecting multiple changesets then create a single work item link for code review purposes. It's really painful to create work item per changeset and assign to a code-reviewer. Is this possible?
1299,1,Patch looks good.
1300,0,Thanks!
1301,1,Excellent! Thank you so much!
1302,0,I need to list out all the jsp/servlet paths and check whether they are user facing or not.
1303,1,I agree: Awesome answer! Thank you so much for this borad overview (even if it may be a little bit outdated by now).
1304,0,No; it's not the same.
1305,0,thanks
1306,1,Thank you Jing for the review.
1307,-1,Absolutely terrible!!! It is not Dependecy Injection
1308,0,To grant new users commit access; check out https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/infrastructure/trunk/subversion/authorization and add the appropriate usernames to the mina= line in the [groups] section of the asf-authorization file.
1309,0,These variables are only used in the next call; I'd remove them
1310,0,The map should also be updated; probably via loop and calls to remove().
1311,0,We have an HTTP discovery agent in activemq-http no other activity on this issue so closing for now.
1312,-1,"I'm not clear if ""${workspace_loc:gitiles-parent}"" mean ""$WORKSPACE/gitiles-parent"" or if it means ""Path to the project named ""gitiles-parent"". When I changed the on-disk location (via the rename above) of my gitiles checkout (under my /src/workspaces directory) to /src/workspaces/gitiles-parent then I got to the next error. :)"
1313,0,possibly add a commented out example of packet-foo.src
1314,1,Solved; in case anyone stumbles upon similar problem.
1315,1,@panique No worries!
1316,1,If we converted helper code to Groovy; we would have the Elvis operator. And closures to handle the try+finally+close idiom. Just sayin' ;)
1317,0,you could use `self.patchobject` from HeatTestCase; that does all the boilerplate for you. Or use @mock.patch.object as class decorator; as you seem to use this mock in all tests.
1318,0,"This works for the example I provided in the review of the patch set 4 but it still fails to render ""\r"" in a little bit different case. For example change this file content:  aaa\r\n bbb\r\n ccc\r\n  to:  aaa\r\n bbb\n ccc\n ddd\r\n  and the diff will again not show the ""\r"" at the end of bbb in the old version. The reason is the expectation that \r is followed by an (optional) </span> and then \n. This will not be the case for the example above. However; expecting the </span> and \n after \r is unnecessary.  Showing CR shouldn't be any more complex than showing tabs. We should simply search for ""\r"" and replace it with:  <span class=""ledos"" title=""CR"">\\r</span>  So this method should become:  private SafeHtml showLineEndings(SafeHtml src) { final String r = ""<span class=\""lecr\"""" + "" title=\"""" + PrettifyConstants.C.leCR() + ""\"""" // + "">\\\\r</span>""; src = src.replaceAll(""\r""; r); return src; }  It could also be inlined at the line 339."
1319,0,I think clearing private fields should work in all JVMs; since that's what the call to f.setAccessible(true) is for. Those fields were final too before DERBY-23; and it looks like modifying final fields via reflection didn't work prior to Java 5; even when calling setAccessible() first. The tests also fail on 1.4.2 (both Sun and IBM).
1320,-1,"on the root window is how xbindkey does it. Be careful about having some alternative method of killing the grab though; it's very annoying to have to go somewhere to into your own box just to kill that process... And that's why; if it was me; +""echo 'moo' > /tmp/moo-fifo"" would be the way to do it. That way; you could also control it in any number of other ways you haven't thought of yet."
1321,1,I still think it's not the best design; but I did quite a bit of testing and can say with a good bit of confidence that it had no real impact on performance.
1322,0,Based on the stacktrace; your output directory is not empty.
1323,1,It proved the point. They are very excited about SO now.
1324,0,the underlying protobuf handles the null properly.
1325,0,Fixed in SVN.  Will let Vincenzo close it if he is satisfied.
1326,1,I wrote a tool to create SVG maps : which also has a world map that you can customize to your liking: Hope this will help you or any other folks who are after a customizable world map!
1327,0,IMHO; Configuration should be the first or the the last arguments.
1328,0,Smart pointers are initialized to NULL already in there constructor.
1329,0,I see no gain to make it singleton (Scala object) too. No need to change it without reason.
1330,1,Pretty sure this was fixed by the time we released JRuby 1.6.
1331,1,"The latest patch looks pretty good to me. Two small nits; +1 once these are addressed: # Generally in the Hadoop codebase we put the ""@Test"" annotation right above the method declaration; below the method comment: {code} +  @Test +  /* +   * test #toString() for typical VolumeId equality classes +   */ {code} # In the class declaration of INVALID_VOLUME_ID; I recommend putting a blank line between the methods being declared there.  Thanks a lot for improving the test coverage in this area of the code; Ivan; and thanks a lot to Andrew for your reviews of these patches."
1332,0,Fixed in subversion repository as of r1328492
1333,1,+1 Very interesting question!
1334,1,I just use following code right now. The table is MyISAM 90MB. terms has FULLTEXT INDEX and it is varchar(255). There are 1;000;000 rows on the table. I wonder if there is any solution which is more resource usage friendly than fulltext search on MySQL? Especially in terms of memory. By saying solution; I refer to any solution such as other types of databases; table structures etc. and if the solution would be adaptable to a standart VPS or hosting in general; it would be extremely super duper perfect! Thanks for your time!
1335,-1,Link is now dead :(
1336,1,this class; funny coincidence :) What are you thoughts about QueryParser being able to know about custom Query implementations?
1337,0,Thank you in advance!
1338,0,You can close this out.
1339,0,Should be ColumnHeaderAutoResizeStyle::ColumnContent
1340,1,i really love the jquery validation plugins; look neat stylish and accessible; but as you know JavaScript can be turned off and boom your user can enter what ever he wants; therefore you should validate on server too; so what is the best approach here ? do double validation one with jquery and one on server side or is there a better solid secure way ?
1341,0,Moving this logic to ProcjectControl will also require additional modifications in ReceiveCommits. My approach fixes both issues in one place. Also this approach protect us from making same error in future. Personally I wouldn't move this logic to upper level. Signature of this method can be changed to canCreate(Map<Stirng; Ref>; RevWalk; RevObject) instead of using Repository. But IMO will keep this logic here  to prevent from this issue in future.
1342,0,The failure of GdiplusStartup happened to because this function was called from a native method with RSP not aligned to 16 bytes.
1343,0,Attaching a patch that adds javadoc in the FileSystem class.
1344,1,Thanks Harsh; good to know.
1345,1,Committed; thanks Jingwei.
1346,1,Thanks Alex. It looks like a good path to solve this issue.
1347,1,Excellent! Did you know that you can answer your own question and accept it as **the** answer. This is considered a good practice; because it helps people looking for answers see that there is an answer and it helps them find the answer. If the answer is only in comments; the question will appear unanswered.
1348,0,Where is `bInfo` defined?
1349,-1,My bad.
1350,-1,This question is awfully vague.. and doesn't seem to have anything to do with programming..
1351,0,Hi I have a sample log file here.
1352,0,I'll try the approach you suggested.
1353,0,A small description of application is as follow.
1354,-1,A unit test should do the same thing every time that it runs; otherwise you may run into a situation where the unit test only fails occasionally; and that could be a real pain to debug. Try seeding your pseudo-randomizer with the same seed every time (in the test; that is--not in production code). That way your test will generate the same set of inputs every time. If you can't control the seed and there is no way to prevent the function you are testing from being randomized; then I guess you are stuck with an unpredictable unit test. :(
1355,0,Is there a C# equivalent for ?
1356,0,Resubmitting and making it a blocker for 0.22
1357,0,Do you plan to address the runtime problem with N calls to cinder; where N is the number of hosts?
1358,0,Say I have a input field which will only accept a CODE_FRAGMENT when the submit button is pressed.
1359,-1,Sorry Avdhesh; I forgot to add these two files to the patch; here is the new patch containing the missing files
1360,0,"You ""workaround"" of making it transient is the correct solution. "
1361,1,I wonder if eventually we should put these in the file table as well :) Not in this change; though.
1362,0,similar comments to the other one; you should use pieforms or a template for the form here; and adding to info_msg is probably not the most ideal way
1363,0,They should be adjusted to the best settings based on the wiki info.
1364,0,Which language and/or regex engine is it for?
1365,1,mechanize ended up giving me the most functionality...thx
1366,0,Have you tried the standard maven untangling tricks like deleting ~/.m2?
1367,0,# New TestTopDocsCollector as well as test cases in TestSort.
1368,1,I would recommend -- it's an excellent CMS with great built-in translation.
1369,0,Link is down again.
1370,-1,tricky shit man! I think I found the issue!
1371,1,Integrated to 0.92; 0.94 and trunk. Thanks for the patch; Chunhui. Thanks for the review; Lars.
1372,0,From It works very fine! Here is how you can make an InputStream for a BufferedImage:
1373,0,This is going to be a big performance hit.
1374,0,Method 2 will not work if run as administrator
1375,-1,Sorry for the wild goose chase!
1376,0,Fixed in SCA Java 1.2 rc4.
1377,0,As far as I can tell from documentation; no exceptions are thrown.  Reworking it slightly anyway (move chdir closer to _FindOrphans loop) and adding try/finally for safety against possibly careless maintenance programming.
1378,0,but (early optimization == root(evil)) != (Performance doesen't matter)
1379,-1,My bad.
1380,-1,no; I'd like to keep the API of this class close to ObjectId
1381,0,See attached patch.
1382,0,When the line is empty; it will return an empty string; CODE_FRAGMENT; not CODE_FRAGMENT.
1383,0,At this point I'd suggest  peppering the docs with references to @Resource wherever it discusses autowiring things or about collections.
1384,0,3.1.0-incubating released!
1385,1,I just committed this. Thanks Amareshwari!
1386,0,This is a list in python.
1387,0,Commenting it out in src/test/log4j.properties isn't enough. Setting it to ERROR works though.
1388,1,Very well put; I really like this !!!
1389,0,"I'm asserting that cloning a VM doesn't constituent ""easy to do"" regardless of your skill set as running the app then ends up being a pain. Others thresholds for ""easy"" may differ but I don't think (without evidence) enough will to matter."
1390,0,+1 on the patch.
1391,1,+1 That looks like an excellent resource!
1392,0,I need to keep the files & folders on two Windows-based; non-domain machines synchronized across a public network. I was thinking rsync over SSH - but I was wondering if there is a simpler solution? Any possibility of using the sync framework over SFTP/SCP/SSH? Or I'm open to better ideas?
1393,0,The client stubs were generated with wsdl2java command of CXF distribution.
1394,0,No other platform requires apps to be built as static libs with command-line tools and then linked into an app with Xcode. No precedent doesn't mean it's not needed. This file must be included in *every* app .pro file. Suggestions; or it stays...
1395,-1,I am trying to search my bash history similarly as with CTRL-r; but to forward direction. It has been a pain for me; when I just hit once too often CTRL-r; to find the previous command again. How can you forward search your Bash history similarly as in reverse searching?
1396,-1,This is probably caused because you have set to (Which is absolutely terrible). (See ) You should disable register globals so that the SESSION/POST/GET/REQUEST/COOKIE variables do not interfere.
1397,0,Hi; Corinne; did you attach the wrong patch?
1398,0,"The problem is not that the exception text is lost completely; it does come through; just that it is wrapped in an AvroRuntimeException(""Unknown datum type: ""+datum) error."
1399,1,Excellent! Thanks for the info.
1400,0,Assume you have this directory layout.
1401,0,You need to do error detection etc.. Perhaps its easier to just build up a single buffer; and then call a single function to write everything to disk so that you have a single place to add file IO error detection (and logging).
1402,0,Attach patch v2.
1403,0,Ah; ok ... thanks for the heads up.
1404,1,@massive I've replied to your question about dealing with concurrency issues in bulk updates by editing my answer. Hope this helps!
1405,0,The piece of cake was bigger than my mouth... Postponed.
1406,1,I can't get any event triggers to work. A simplified example of what I'm doing is below - I know there is a event on Border since it is defined in but I'm still getting Cannot convert string 'MouseEnter' in attribute 'RoutedEvent' to object of type 'System.Windows.RoutedEvent' as soon as i run the application. Any help would be hugely appreciated.
1407,0,Thanks in advance to everyone.
1408,0,Thanks for the reviews; Bikas and Aaron.
1409,1,that was from something else - that apparently the fragmentmanager holds on to fragments. But you're right - it doesn't make any difference one way or the other. Nice library by the way - extremely useful!
1410,0,I'm no angel; and I'm not perfect about this myself.
1411,0,Sample client; server and broker configuration.
1412,0,This sounds reasonable to me.
1413,-1,Here is an incredibly disgusting way to do it: Here is a better way (I think): If you convert either output string with: you get your original number.
1414,0,Can i use the Object o parameter specified in the vote interface method?
1415,0,Should be a quick review.
1416,0,Multiple Threads ( Inner classes implementing Runnable ) sharing a Data Structure ( instance variable of the FILE_NAME ).
1417,0,Question is of course: what is a solution to use the result of Oracle function for the new value of the ID?
1418,-1,Ah - and if SHA-1 is so expensive that adding that salt will in fact cost the hacker years then it is also going to be so expensive that you'll probably be suffering to add to CC number 10;000. But you can always just test it vs your expected customer base size and see if it hurts of not.
1419,-1,I have an asp:Menu control that has four different menu items in it. Each menu item has a graphic and a text description. My problem is the icon and text have no padding between them and it just looks ugly! Does anyone know how I can force a bit of padding between the image and text of the menu item? I've looked at all of the attributes on the asp:Menu control; but I haven't been able to find one for this; but I may have just missed it.
1420,0,Probably your answer is better given as a comment.
1421,0,Verified at revision 473588.
1422,1,"Thank you for the excellent answers! @ArnoldSpence is correct: It is indeed a case of memory fragmentation. I confirmed this by modifying my example above to allocate a series of 49 MB buffers after the reaching the ""OUT OF MEMORY"" condition. Sure enough; these all succeeded (up to the 2GB limit)."
1423,-1,I had the same issue using a remote postgres instance.
1424,0,Local test passed. Submit to hudson.
1425,0,I ran it on current trunk.
1426,0,Go ahead commit Nitay.
1427,0,Committed to trunk with revision 467578. Committed to 10.2 with revision 467580.
1428,0,"Does string immutability work by statement; or by strings within a statement? For example; I understand that the following code will allocate two strings on the heap. ""hello"" will remain on the heap until garbage collected; and s now references ""hello world!"" on the heap. However; how many strings does the following line allocate on the heap...1 or 2? Also; is there a tool/way to verify the results?"
1429,-1,Ternary gets _extremely_ ugly if you're using more than one else statement; I wouldn't recommend it at all; let alone in this situation.
1430,-1,When you say it didn't detect it do you really mean you were collecting everything and the packet you wanted wasn't there? I find that hard to believe. It doesn't need any configuration; it just works. Getting a sensible filter so it gets what you want and not loads of other crap is harder!
1431,0,This is quite new in Django (since 1.0).
1432,0,( see: this answer ).
1433,0,We don't need this line any more. Or we could keep this here and use it instead of calling parseInt in the five instances below.
1434,-1,This creates an unnecessary garbage list. Sets.newHashSet should accept an Iterable.
1435,0,No; n % 7 + 1 actually returns n + 1 unless n == 7 in which case it returns 1.
1436,0,Can you please submit a patch?
1437,0,Field length expected here is 2; but field below is FT_INT32. Is this an unsigned short (FT_UINT16) ?
1438,1,Integrated to 0.94 and trunk. Thanks for the patch Jimmy. Thanks for the review; Andy.
1439,0,Problem is the floating image in license stops the bottom margin working. I've added in a cb div and added some margin top to the feedback box
1440,-1,This doesn't work properly when the index is negative (e.g. time is before the offset).
1441,0,What's happening?
1442,-1,i don't think this is ever defined on Android. it's a BSD thing.
1443,0,Attached
1444,1,Excellent; thank you! i did not now that.
1445,0,This patch fixes the issue: # Short circuits the MUST_PASS_ONE case just like it is done in the MUST_PASS_ALL case.
1446,0,After configure FILE_NAME to handle the payment process; following the instructions from here; I run my application and try checkout an order with paypal.
1447,1,Wow!! The question sounds like question for working in the kitchen. I am amazed the names used for the tools :)
1448,0,See also `Is there a Java equivalent or methodology for the typedef keyword in C++? '
1449,0,Jacques; if you create separate issues for the erros (icluding the logs) I can take a look them.
1450,0,Perhaps you have not set up the terminal settings Follow the steps below : Open terminal Go to your folder where you want to install cocos2d write Cocos2d will install successfully Enjoy Programming !!
1451,-1,Managing url paths can be a real pain in ASP.NET. AbsolutePath vs RelativePath vs etc. drives me crazy. I find that many solutions require the user to edit web.config element to include the correct subfolder path; ex. Website Root: Web.config setting: / Website Root: web.config setting: /blog/ Is there a way to properly handle this without having to make changes to the web.config?
1452,1,great; thanks Joel.
1453,0,Choose Project -> Properties Select Configuration -> General In the box for how you should link MFC; choose to statically link it. Choose Linker -> Input. Under Additional Dependencies; add any libraries you need your app to statically link in. For more info; see this article:
1454,0,A related question: Have you faced the issue of making the same code work with 2005 and 2008. If yes; how did you solve it?
1455,0,I did a quick Google search and didn't see anything super-great to automate creation and updating of my google sitemap for the ruby on rails app. Any suggestions?
1456,0,Checked in the patch (see revision 1295288).
1457,1,numpy is awesome :P
1458,0,It could also be a problem if you worried about running out of ID too fast (if you expect LOTS of records); since you're only using 1/10 of the range you have storage for.
1459,0,Hi Vincent; I wasn't aware of that.
1460,0,There are several options.
1461,-1,I hate Dev-C++ but because of a library; I have to use it!!! What's the matter for Dev-C++ or are there errors in my code about using referance variable? Error: 9 C:***\main.c syntax error before '&' token
1462,0,That means you need to use the Google FILE_NAME files.
1463,0,If you decide to use events to drive your swf in order to approximate different frame rates I'd recommend using a tween engine like . It's free (as in beer) and I've used it very successfully for frame based tweening in the past.
1464,1,Thank you Jing.
1465,1,([0-1 ]?[0-9]|2[0-3]):([0-5][0-9]) I think that's the regex you're looking for (not specifically for javascript though). This site has an excellent amount of info for language-specific regular expressions! Cheers!
1466,1,Thanks for your comments; Konstantin.
1467,-1,I am not sure why I can not get it to work and have been struggling with it for a while.
1468,-1,Someone on StackOverflow had similar problem.
1469,1,Maybe this will be of some help -
1470,-1,I don't like either style. Don't like c here. I can change it if it helps to get this pulled.
1471,0,Take a look - email is sent using ; so you could just add: to the .
1472,1,Good point; I missed that.  Determinism is a key feature.  Fixed.
1473,1,great great great; that's what I was looking for !
1474,0,We have fixed this in the twitter fork. You can review the fix at https://github.com/twitter/bookkeeper/commit/a48472911b176d75905399e7c32bb782f3564b83 If you are fine with the change; I will submit this as a patch.
1475,0,I think just needed for this at mo.
1476,1,An alternative to recording would be to use the MS Speech API with C#; enter the words via keyboard; and have it state what was keyed in. Just a thought... Good luck on your app -- it sounds like a really cool program!
1477,-1,This does seem to be the answer. Absolutely terrible API design.
1478,0,Hope am not missing anything?
1479,0,*.. info.ftl might have confused you :) Divesh

1483,0,yes;- this is HDFS-4866 releated. I've added reference.

1491,0,missed encoding for non-array request parameters. It doesn't look like I can remove previously attached files.  Whoever is reviewing the code  should use the latest patch.
1492,0,So you can easy reduce count of objects by factor two ( one byte [ ] instead of pair String + char [ ] ); and array length of UTF-8 symbols usually less than length of UTF-16 chars.

1509,1,With the new design; they could also support other encodings in future.
1510,0,However; as a tactical decision imposed by the implementation of the typechecker; we will require a matching {{apply}} method for every {{set}} method; and will reassess this issue later in the context of a possible typechecker redesign.
1511,0,Jason; did you get a chanse to try this out? It seems to work fine for me and I plan to pop it in the trunk in a few days. I think I'll have to add a warning of some kind in runtime though as it could slow down the index a bit if the reader is way fragmented.
1512,1,Excellent question! I can't figure this out either. Please post the answer here if you figure it out.
1513,-1,Hi Guillaume; I did not have an answer right away; so I sent you question to Leonard Rosenthol.

1516,1,Reviewing the MSDN docs for the functions listed ; I see that the function checks with the SMBIOS table; which is referenced by a standard It appears that you indeed can find the information you seek through the BIOS. You may have to install a driver to get that information out to your program. Good luck!

1518,0,At least it was intuitive for me; and I am pretty new to all this.
1519,-1,Oops; it is my fault. Please defer this patch; I'll raise jira for other classes/interface as its dependance soon; sorry for inconvenience.
1520,1,I would just use an @import command at the top of my CSS file; then you can simply add a new font by adding a pipeline to the end of the font and type the name of any other fonts you want. To use them; simply use the CSS font-family style command: HTML Hope this helped!
1521,0,The .md extension is used for the readme because it's in MarkDown format; used by GitHub.

1539,0,From step 3; do you think the double-splitting is a new phenomenon?  It doesn't sound like something that should happen very often.  Maybe that would explain why i didn't get this error in .94.0. Also; please note I went straight from .94.0 to .94.2; so I don't know if it was present in .94.1.
1540,0,Looks like the null should be dropped. Previously it was null for the attributes; then Evonne added {'class': 'title'}

1555,0,Done Yes it does. This kind of test aimes at checking the resolution of existing namespaces. I actually did not think about nested namespaces with the same name might be a problem when creating new namespaces in the source. I've added a test for being sure.

1557,1,Hi John; I would agree; using object notification is probably a cleaner way to do this.
1558,0,So I went ahead and made the change.

1570,-1,Understood. To me it would have been safer to keep the chain as is; but introduce the validation check explicitly; but if you think this is okay too; then I'll shut up.
1571,1,@Guffa: a *very* excellent question. There's not typically a good reason to do so.
1572,1,Great! Good to hear it. Can you please accept my answer? :)

1592,0,gpu_info is still available when this gets called; so it can be safely passed to free_gpu(). The only inconvenience is that if mdrun crashes or gets killed; the driver won't set the clocks back to the original values. I guess this could be an RFE - nvml could distinguish between admin and user access and tell the driver to set the clocks back after the application terminates.
1593,-1,How I hate myserlf!
1594,-1,When I apply on()-handlers I prefer the following notation if I have more than one to apply: Does anybody knows how to set a namespace within this notation? I solved the problem in this case with falling back to a single notation: But I really hate to repeat myself. Same issue/question for using the off()-method with more than one handler. This works: I bet the off()-thing is a easy one; but I don't get it after coding the last 15 hours.
1595,-1,Makes sense; and it's very similiar to what I am doing. One ant task for stage and one for production; and just using the defaults for local development. But pain arises from mainting 3 different applicationcontexts which have almost identical content..

1604,1,Red color isn't really important; it was just a suggestion to be more homogeneous ... but that can be revisited in a different jira. I agree an option is a good idea for automatically acknowledging hosts.  Not sure what the default should be: the current behavior is obviously to not confirm; so we could keep that one; or go for a safer one; I don't have any strong opinion on that.
1605,0,I'm having the same issue; did you find a fix?
1606,0,What kinds of considerations are there for migrating an application from NHibernate 1.2 to 2.0? What are breaking changes vs. recommended changes? Are there mapping issues?
1607,0,Instead; to access methods in the JRE you have to include little wrapper methods in your jar files that you loaded into the database.

1610,0,Thanks; Kevin
1611,0,This won't work in multlib build. You need to turn it into a target-specific variable (like the PRIVATE_TARGET_LIBATOMIC). Or can we merge PRIVATE_TARGET_LIBATOMIC; PRIVATE_TARGET_LIBGCOV and PRIVATE_TARGET_LIBGCC to a single PRIVATE_ variable?
1612,-1,Sorry for the noise.

1614,0,(style)  code indent should use tabs where possible (style)  space prohibited between function name and open parenthesis '('
1615,0,It really *did* happen in an earlier version though....
1616,-1,Instead of loading everything which is neither possible nor really desirable I would use a sliding window instead - when you reach a certain maximum list size (say i.e. 300 items) you automatically remove the top 100 items when you add the next 100 items to the bottom. If you scroll just right after the update this shouldn't even be noticeable by your users.
1617,1,I have added the modulo because if int is actually 64 bits then the snprintf would mangle the string for values >= 2^32. OTOH it is quite unlikely that we ever see such high numbers(?); but you are right it is not really a good solution. I'll push a version that will work with 64 bits ints and the refined error message. Thanks a lot for taking the time to write the review!

1625,0,I've run into this problem a couple times now. Last time; I wanted to create an array of arrays (matrix) of BOOL's. I ended up encapsulating them in NSStrings; because apparently NSArray only has arrays of objects. This time; want an array of arrays again; but of CGPoints. I'm going to be using these to draw images to the screen. Is there a way to create an array of CGPoints without them being objects? Should I even worry about the memory/performance overhead of having a matrix of 96 objects?

1641,0,Instead of logging to the console; log to a file and then track the file with a separate gui application. This keeps the console uncluttered and gives you a more persistent record of your log; which occasionally is extremely useful. There are various libraries which will do most of this for you; or you can keep it simple and just do it yourself.

1657,0,Hrm; I'm not sure how best to handle this.  StackOverflow has a 'Display Name' attribute; does anything similar exist for LDAP & OpenID? I'd prefer to just show the firstname to save on space.  If we end up showing the full name; I wonder if we could put the name to the left of the search bar and have the search bar expand over it when active; to save on horizontal space.
1658,1,Thanks for the suggestion Raghu.  Let me try it.
1659,0,My problem with Boost (here; and elsewhere) is that you can often get on without it (in this case with C++11 or before C++11 [with a function](http://stackoverflow.com/a/138633/111307)). Boost adds a significant compile time overhead; had tons of files to park into your repository (and to have to copy around/zip/extract if you are making an archive). That's the reason I try not to use it. I know you can choose what files to include/not include; but you usually don't want to have to worry about Boost's cross dependencies with itself so you just copy the whole thing around.
1660,0,be very afraid?
1661,-1,When querying from the database using Entity Framework; what exceptions should one catch and what should be done about them? Generally I use because I have no specific action or feedback for every possible type of error; but I am constantly reminded that this is a terrible idea and that specific exceptions should be caught and handled! Example: What are the standards/guidelines for handling EF exceptions?
1662,1,It is all good; I found this to be very helpful. The following article is excellent !
1663,0,This said; HttpClient is a general purpose HTTP agent and as such should follow the letter of the specification rather than make informed guesses.
1664,-1,Sorry for the misspelling ;)
1665,-1,I actually misguided you here. typeName was already fully qualified and looks enough to figure out what the message was saying and find culprits. (for some reason I thought this was the member name and not qualified). Anyway sorry about that. You may consider reverting the related change to keep it consistent and make the code slightly simpler by getting rid of maps. Anyway I will leave it up to you how to proceed.
1666,1,You're very welcome ! It would be nice though if you upvoted and accepted the answer. This way other users could refer to it if they pass to the same trouble you had =P
1667,0,Pretty fancy.
1668,1,Committed to trunk. Thanks; Prasanth!
1669,-1,What you are asking is inherently impossible. The game runs on the client and is therefore completely at the user's mercy. Only way to be sure is running a real time simulation of the game on the server based on user's input (mouse movement; keypresses); which is absolutely ridiculous.
1670,0,I see what you mean; I didn't make the distinction between zero values and missing values. But I am actually using a PreferenceInferrer that fills in 0 for missing values. When I do that; the break still happens before the other dimensions are included in the calculations of sumX or sumY.

So unless *you* implemented search for Gluster Volumes in the Backend; the user will not be able to search. So; unless you did indeed implement this in Backend - please remove this url parameter
1676,-1,Why this special case? It did not exist before and all it callers seem to take it from a tvb (except for a hard-coded 2000 in EnhancedAlarmMessage; which seems wrong too as the length is not checked there?)

1678,1,Committed to trunk. Thanks; Sushanth!
1679,1,Great question!
1680,-1,You have a potential problem here with MMCONF_SUPPORT. This option indicates hardware has PCI-e config register access in MMIO space in addition to the legacy 0xcf8/0xcfc IO registers. A second option MMCONF_SUPPORT_DEFAULT is not set; so by default you would use PCI IO config access. But since those are non-atomic; SMI handler in i82801ix explicitly uses MMIO and you have no MMCONF_BASE_ADDRESS set.
1681,1,No worries! Joe
1682,1,Thanks for the recommendation. I've just talked to them and I'm getting a demo. It looks good on paper; I really hope its can handle what I'm looking for.

The EXC_BAD_ACCESS is probably because; under the covers; it's trying to access an object stored at wherever your int is pointing to. In other words; it's using your int as a pointer to an NSObject and failing horribly when it does so.

1706,0,"{quote} I don't think it makes sense to argue about who the exception messages are for [...] {quote}  I think the opposite; because it has an impact on the library design. Not that CM cannot go on with the current way; but my point is that Luc and you are focusing on top-level users while stressing that CM in a low-level component. To me; that is a blatant contradiction that produces drawbacks which I presented in several usage examples (which you didn't address); while you always reply with a single use case where the user is yourself (i.e. a CM developer). Anyone else who is using a high-level application based on CM will be baffled by the ""detailed exception message"" because; in all but the most trivial case; his actions will have only a remote connection to the exception triggered by CM. I'm pinpointing at a minute detail of the design of CM; explaining that it can come in the way of some direct users of CM. The current long list of errors is in fact imposing your view (of what is important) to future application developers. [As an example; let's say that someone wants to create a GUI (e.g. for the statistician referred to above); he will want to define his own detailed error messages to be displayed in the GUI with a formatting of his choice. The statistician will never see the messages created by CM.] If a CM exception (resulting from a precondition violation) reaches the end-user level; it means there was some unanticipated problem in the call chain. And to correct it; one would need more than just the ""detailed message"": the end-user will pass the stack trace to the application developer; who will correct a possible bug in his code (such as a missing check of a precondition) or pass it on the the CM developers.

1765,-1,I am about to alter the several tables in a massive system which I probably only understand around 10%. I want to add three columns. One of these is just a rename of an existing column. Part of me wants to :- Rename the column but worried about the impact on unknown parts of the system that use the old name. Append the three columns to the table therefore making the old column redundant (over time).

Do you usually want the Cascade behavior here? Do I need to worry about something besides making sure both sides of this association end up with the same table name?
1780,1,If it's not set; there's no way to get FSP failure data out.  I agree that it's not an absolute requirement; but without it; if there's a failure; you're going to be pretty lost.

You shall have a look on the great tutorial: http://adit.io/posts/2012-04-14-working_with_HTML_in_haskell.htmlBut it is also good to have the arrow concept for functions. For example the following code just works; because is an instance of the arrow class (The operator is defined in Control.Arrow).Thanks to the arrow syntax you have also a great tool to write complex computations in Haskell (it works as well for functions; monads and XML filters in HXT).

You can do it like this:(The bits marked with autonomous transaction have to be called in a separate method as an autonomous transaction.

1830,-1,We're running into a really painful issue with Honeycomb's here; and I was wondering if anyone else has found a solution. The problem itself is quite simple: We frequently trigger background tasks in Activity or ; since most of our screens must display data loaded from a Web service. While these tasks are running; we show the ActionBar's refresh spinner and animate it. The problem is: onCreate and onResume are executed before is; so at the point where we start the task; the refresh spinner doesn't even exist. Hence; it won't animate. I don't see any simple way around this. I guess we could keep the information about a task being spawned in onCreate; and as soon as the ActionBar becomes available; update it accordingly. But still; I can't believe a use case as common as this is so difficult to do with ActionBar?

1866,-1,Sorry; this is still unacceptable. ImplEESdrWriter::ImplWriteShape() is used by both the binary export and the OOXML filter; you need to set the OOXML flag in the OOXML filter. Jut put a breakpoint on this line in the debugger; see its backtrace; and set the flag in the first method that is already OOXML-specific; and pass the bool around till this line.

1874,0,If you are really worried about memory you can put those images in a global image (or your custom object) array instead of putting it in a local variable. Take a global variable Use timer (i.e. setTimeOut ) to check if the din contains img tag with class . If it does not find any matching element (and image_cleaned is false ) then delete that array. Then set . Then remove timer (optional but better).

1890,0,Like skip.jar.loading= true once ---> Proposed behaviour.
1891,0,It comes down to 'designing for testability'. Ideally; you should not instantiate those COM objects directly but should access them through a layer of indirection that can be replaced by a mock object. Now; COM itself does provide a level of indirection and you could provide a mock object that provided a substitute for the real one but I suspect it would be a pain to create and I doubt if you'd get much help from an existing mocking framework.

1893,-1,The other day I noticed that if I run IEInspector's HttpAnalyser and capture the post data when logging into my bank account or amazon account the post data shows my user name and password in the clear. This is a little concerning. Does anyone know at what point the SSL encryption takes place? This I assume would mean that any software that is installed on your machine could potentially get access to this post data. Very scary.

1903,-1,I am new to this so maybe i'm doing somthing wrong.
1904,1,"I apologize for taking so long to get to reviewing this.  This has some good elements but also quite a few problems.  Here are a few suggestions.  1. The bindingGBeans do not need to know the name of the gbean they are getting something to bind into jndi from; they need a reference to it.  Similarly they do not need to bind a naming Reference; they can bind the object itself.  For instance; the connector binding gbean can do something like this:  private final ManagedConnectionFactoryWrapper managedConnectionFactoryWrapper; // this is the reference to the gbean that gives us the connection factory to bind  ...  //now it's time to bind the connection factory  Object connectionFactory = managedConnectionFactoryWrapper.$getResource(); globalContext.bind(jndiName; connectionFactory);  This is also going to affect how the builders set up the binding gbeans: they know the name of the appropriate gbean such as managedConnectionFactoryWrapper; since they just created it; so they need to use that name to set the reference pattern in the binding gbean.  The binding gbean will then get (a proxy to) the ""real"" gbean that it can use as outlined above.  2. I don't see an implementation of a writable thread safe jndi Context; as dain pointed out you would need.  3. The zip file consists almost entirely of irrelevant files and the actual source files do not all appear to be in the geronimo project structure.  This makes it extremely hard to figure out what to look at.  4. Some of the code modifications (such as to ServiceConfigBuilder) appear to be test cases rather than production code.  It will be a lot easier to evaluate your work if you keep test cases and production code clearly separated as is done in typical maven projects.  5. I think you will need to redo the openejb work after dain's reintegration of his container rewrite.  Thanks!  Let us know if you have any questions about this."

Search for question where this answered. Also; don't use exceptions for non-exceptional cases and *always* throw something derived from `std::exception`: once you have tried to locate where an exception came from which isn't derived from `std::exception` in a program with a few million lines of code you'll find it extremely helpful to look at what `what()` returns!

1977,0,Well; since you didn't respond to my request I finally did without and checked out what you did. First of all looking at CIncludeTransformer I have to say that I don't understand why it is doing its own caching. Caching should be the concern of pipelines and sources. If you want preemptive loading of cached content this would much better be implemented as a Source wrapper. In fact we now have such a class in the scratchpad area. One unpleasant implication of the current design is that as an unsuspecting user of this class; when you turn on caching in this transformer; the cached contents of any included cocoon:// source that identifies a caching pipeline would be cached twice! Once by the pipeline itself and once by the CIncludeTransformer. Now concerning your patch. I don't quite understand why you retain the validity of the cached contents. The algorithm the caching pipeline uses to determine the validity of the cached contents is as follows: first it looks at the validity of the cached pipeline contents itself; then if the validity by itself indicates it needs a current validity to check against then the pipeline contructs a pipeline validity by calling the participating components' getValidity() methods. If your component now returns the same validity object that you previously returned then  that does not make much sense to me. Since I really needed this functionality myself and I didn't have enough time to discuss and refactor the CIncludeTransformer I implemented my own very basic IncludeTransformer that does exactly what I need; no more no less. I'll post it here if anyone want to use it. I also looked at the XIncludeTransformer to see if I could implement caching in that one instead. But it seems that the XIncludeTransformer reads included content from URL objects instead of from Source objects.
1978,1,from a really geeky perspective; that is really cool!

1987,0,Here is a brief description of it.
1988,1,Thanks Jon. +1. Patch looks good. Minor nitpick I have is that it would be nice to give the test a more relevant name than testAutomaticallyMadeName. Something like testRelationAliasForBinCond. But I am not going to insist. 
1989,-1,I don't think this is the way we should do it. The routine execute_x86cpuid is obviously *x86*-specific; and that is why it is only defined on certain x86 platforms. For other platforms we should never call this routine; but then we should add proper #ifdefs around that call. We will gradually get more detection routines; so it does not make sense to have all routines available on all architectures; but usually non-functional.

2054,0,Indeed; but OP asked for a character not a substring. Of course if you interpret character broadly to include multibyte characters; `strstr` is the right function to use.

2080,0,Having had some experience with using a thick client through VPN; I'd say go with some kind of web app. If done wrong; a thick client can become really painful to use through a VPN because of data churning. A web app concentrates all of that on the server; which makes it much better from that point of view. Other benefits: no deployment hassle no direct access to the database from the user machine. Evidently it also depends on your skills; and on how much time/budget you have...

2103,0,In my mental model of authentication; a user should be distinct from the way they log in. So for example; a User could have an associated EmailLogin (with an email/password); or they could have many (or none). Similarly they could have 0..* associated OpenIDLogin credentials. Are there any existing authentication libraries for Rails which use this method? Alternatively; is this a really terrible idea?

However; I've been surprised to find there's not a lot out there about how to do this 'idiomatically' using the various popular JavaScript frameworks.

2133,0,JB; do you expect problems when we upgrade Camel 2.10.0 to Spring 3.1.0 (and deploy it into Karaf 2.2.x)? Because Camel leverage on the Karaf Spring feature; it will use Spring 3.0.x when running inside Karaf 3.0x and Spring 3.1.x when running in Karaf 3.0.x. IMO; when we can upgrade to Spring 3.1.0 without any modification; it should not a problem...
2134,0,we cannot find a problem in our implementation anymore; perhaps there is a problem in he ACF implementation that force a other resultat.
2135,0,So; which solution did you go for in the end?
2136,-1,Damn.
2137,0,I bet it cannot be simpler than that:
2138,0,I would suggest you always take a normalized approach to your database schema and then later decided if you need to create a solution for performance reasons. Premature optimization can be dangerous. Premature database de-normalization can be disastrous! I would suggest that you stick with the original schema and later; if necessary; create a reporting table that is a de-normalized version of your normalized schema.

2149,0,Is there a standard way to see how much stack space your app has and what the highest watermark for stack usage is during a run? Also in the dreaded case of actual overflow what happens? Does it crash; trigger an exception or signal? Is there a standard or is it different on all systems and compilers? I'm looking specifically for Windows; Linux and Macintosh.

2156,0,Hi colin; I agree that scatter/gather typically refers to multiple input tuples of (position; length). Yes; we can extend the api to include that. The reason my original proposal did not include that was because I was mostly targetting this api to reduce the number of buffer copies.
2157,1,I loved the wild solution that Marcus offered and it would be great if it could be undeleted!
2158,0,Another option is to create a new type for HdfsLocatedFileStatus as {code} HdfsLocatedFileStatusProto {   HdfsFileStatusProto fs = 1;   LocatedBlocksProto locations = 2; } {code} 
2159,1,I have been told in the past some compilers don't initialize all elements to 0 with 'foo[n]={0};' - I've never found such a compiler; so maybe it's an urban legend. :) memset() yup shoulda done that. Ironically I looked for a memset equivalent in glib; so I don't know why I didn't use it.

2162,0,IncomingStreamReader does clean the tmp file when there is an expection (there's an enclosing 'try catch').
2163,1,That bit can go as well; but it's copied from the commit message - the primary goal of the commit is to ensure that things don't crash; however there was an attempt at making the fix work with the least slowdown. Perhaps that bit can go out and just mention the stuff about re-entrancy :)

2168,1,I'm working with a console application (C#) at the moment. What it does is pulls files from a database and stores them in their relevant folders on the C drive on a local machine. At the moment; every time I run the console app; it pulls ALL the files from the database. What I would like to be able to do; is each time I run it; It only pulls the files that were submitted since I last ran the console application. Currently; this is the linq statement that pulls the files from the database. Ideally I'd like something like the following where the date and time of the last run of the application is stored somewhere: I'm unsure on how to go about achieving this. If anyone had any advice on it I'd be very greatful :)

2180,0,But it'd still be nice to get the actual hotspot bug fixed.
2181,0,Andrey;  I don't quite understand this patch.  For instance; you didn't mention bcprov above but you remove some references to it in build/make/components/extra.xml and build/make/deploy.xml and confusingly the patch doesn't remove build/make/components/extra/bcprov.xml ? This seems a little inconsistent.  Perhaps I'm missing something.

2196,0,If all you are doing here is testing that the object returned by Network.get_by_id is passed to the allocated_fixed_ip() method properly along with some other arguments; the more clean and canonical way of doing that would be this:  @mock.patch('nova.objects.Network.get_by_id'; return_value=mock.sentinel.network) def test_add_fixed_ip_instance_using_id_without_vpn(self; get_by_id_mock): net_id = networks[0]['id'] with mock.patch.object(self.network; 'allocated_fixed_ip') as allocate_mock: self.network.add_fixed_ip_to_instance(self.context; FAKEUUID; HOST; net_id) get_id_mock.assert_called_once_with(self.context; net_id; project_only='allow_none') allocate_mock.assert_called_once_with(self.context; FAKEUUID; mock.sentinel.network; address=None)
2197,0,Interesting. The ruby client have similar feature; but it  doesn't touch the packet (the user should explicitly specify which conversion he'd like to apply to value). I think your solution is good enough. Is it possible to generalize such flag so that I can mark the keys as 'marshalled'. But such generalization won't be portable between clients because all of them use different formats. Another good feature which is connected to value formats is flag which will says that the value is a valid document (json hash) because in this case the client could decide to map it to some high-level object
2198,0,David; I completely agree that providing more intelligence in the PO creation process would be very helpful; especially for larger businesses.
2199,-1,Passing a whole volfile path this way seems a bit fragile.  Would it be possible to pass the flag and a *relative* path; so that the receiver constructs the final path instead of the sender?

2217,0,May be some resources will need to be copied from archives; too.
2218,0,No buddy; You can't simply upgrade ZF1 to ZF2. In case you need you move to ZF2 be sure that ZF2 is not just an upper version of ZF1 but the whole Architecture is also changed.So; If you really need to move then 1. Firstly you will need to remove ZF1 library completely.2. Install ZF2 package.3. Now make changes in your code to work accordingly with ZF2 as most of the things will stop working once to move to ZF2.However; I would suggest don't migrate to ZF2 just for the sake of upgrading; migrate only if you dont have any other choice. As this is a very painful task.have a good luck.

2233,1,Guillaume;  I took a quick look at your suggestions.  I agree that we can reduce the code a bit.  However; I think that we need to keep the activate method as it initializes the servingXml internals.   I'm not sure about the deactivate method.  I also noticed that you have added a patch; but; being new to jira; I'm not sure if that means that you've made changes to my attachment or something else.  Are you still looking for me to correct the formatting and to remove the extraneous methods/classes?  Thanks; James

For example; the wordlist contains the following words [""abuser; abused; abusers; abuse; abuses; etc.] The new file that is created should retain only the word ""abuse"" because it is the ""lowest common denominator"" (if you will) between all those words.

2263,1,"{quote} I don't really know much about NamedSPILoader but I think what you're suggesting. How would we support Factories loading unrelated classes like they can through ResourceLoader now? Assume they're on the classpath and use Class.forName? {quote}  It needs more discussion (and input from Uwe would help!); but it works like Charset.forName(""ASCII"") etc. We use this already for codecs and postingsformats (Codec.forName; Codec.listAllCodecs; ...).  Have a look at lucene/core/src/resources/META-INF/services for the idea. Basically you ""register"" your classes in your jar file this way: additional jar files (e.g. look at lucene/test-framework/src/resources/META-INF) can load more classes.  So this could support some idea like TokenizerFactory.forName(""Whitespace"") or something simple like that. So someone would not need to use org.apache.solr.analysis.xxx namespace to be able to load their analyzer stuff easily; they use whatever package they want and register in their META_INF. And added jar files (other analysis jars); are automatically available this way.  I think Uwe mentioned this idea before; though I think he had Analyzers in mind (e.g. provide language code and get back analyzer or something). Anyway thats for another issue :)  Just something worth consideration if we want to make these modules really pluggable. On the other hand we shouldn't use anything overkill if its not the right fit... "

2308,-1,No; /index.php/Foo is an Apache-mod_php-ism; not a guaranteed feature. Standard PHP anywhere else does not include that handling.

2320,0,when there is a sufficent contructor in the class the entire execution should fail; it shouldn't be catched here and obviously that the code shouldn't handle such cases. there's no need for the boolean as the execution of the register disk logs wether it succeeded or failed; you can log it if you want for case of failure; but i don't see any real need for that.

You can remove the file afterward. The option is actually set in: C:\Documents and Settings[user]\Local Settings\Application Data\Microsoft\VisualStudio[version]\browser.xml However; if you modify the file directly while VS is running; VS will overwrite it with your previous option on next run.

2443,1,Hi Oliver; Thanks for catching this problem and for your suggested fix. We can go one step in simplifying the fix by removing the need for URI altogether if we use the getResourceAsStream() method of ClassLoader rather than getResource(). Modified version of your fix committed in revision 405036. Please could you check that this version of your fix works in your environment. Best regards; George

When I am in this mode I get a box around the same variables and I can change one and instantly all others change. I do not know how to enter this mode ""by will""; I just entered it ""randomly"". Therefore; I really appreciate your suggestions; how to enter this mode; because it is extremely useful to me! PS.: I am using NO plugins; just a plain new eclipse installation with java!"
2445,-1,Sorry; I had attached an older version... let's try this one.
2446,1,I would say yes; it was Anders Heljsberg's intent to make the observer pattern a first-class language feature with events in C#; based on his experience with Delphi. Anders makes this and other design intentions clear in an excellent interview on .
2447,1,Great time saver and hidden gem. Excellent!
2448,0,solved in subversion repository as of r818942.
2449,-1,The cause is that the call to SpecificResponder.writeError in Responder.respond ultimately calls GenericData.resolveUnion which in turn calls GenericData.getSchemaName before the line where the UnresolvedUnionException gets thrown.

2459,1,committed to trunk. thanks Ning.
2460,0,At a guess; you're probably defining your objects in VB as just s; something like this: If so; you're forcing VB to go through the automation interface (IDispatch). Basically; it doesn't know what type you're going to assign to until run-time; so it has to invoke methods on that object via IDispatch::Invoke. To do that; it looks up all the information it needs for an invocation from the object itself at run time.By contrast; your C++ code is probably early-bound; which means offsets into the COM object's vtable are compiled directly into your code. In that case; when/if you change the code so those offsets aren't valid any more; the code will fail horribly.
2461,-1,Sorry to come in late. Some clarifications: # MR1 JT kills all running tasks on a TT when it's deemed 'lost'. # It also kills all completed maps on that TT for 'active' jobs. # The tasks are marked KILLED rather than FAILED and thus don't count towards the job; which is correct since it wasn't the job's fault.  Hope this helps.
2462,0,I have looked to the JNA code of the extraction method.
2463,0,I think we should hardcode the status since the user can only subscribe.
2464,0,the 'id' field of my table auto increases when I insert a row; I want to insert a row and then get that ID. I would do it just as I said it but I'm wondering if there's a way I can do it without worrying about the time between inserting the row and getting the id. I know I can query the database for the row that matches the information that was entered; but there is a high change there will be duplicates; with the only difference being the id.
2465,1,Excellent! Thanks :)
2466,0,This issue is being tracked by other JIRAs now.

2470,-1,Why checking for null pointer here? delete handles null pointers just fine; you only add overhead here.
2471,0,This question is still incredibly vague about what you are looking for. I guess your acceptance of an answer; however; lets us reverse engineer the problem.
2472,0,This is something we can revisit when we collapse all of the permissions catalogs into the master catalog which you are creating.
2473,0,This bug is fixed in 2.7; closing it down per the request by the reporter; Anuj Gupta.
2474,0,Its always fun when you have concurrent applications extracting different versions of your naive library to the same location and filename.

2477,1,excellent; all working now; thanks !
2478,1,Just committed this to trunk and 3.4 branch. Thanks Rakesh!
2479,-1,Hello Oliver; Sorry for the late response. I haven't had any time to look into this again; maybe it was a misuse on my side after all. Since I haven't been working on the project I encountered the behavior in for months; this issue might as well be closed.
2480,0,I don't think that's fair; I never got too deep into WPF but what I did; didn't seem to suffer from these issues (in a lot of ways WPF was a more mature UI technology than HTML). The new javascript-based UIs I think work on a node-style event loop so I don't think the ui thread is even an issue. For all its many many faults; Microsoft does deserve some credit for how its dev tools have evolved.
2481,0,"(If it's just reading ints; I was thinking just write 4-byte ints. That's got to be the fastest of all.) The author would be Ted; really his call. If it's more of an example for the book; it could be attached to the book. If it stays that's cool too; just need to have a think about fixing/documenting the issues raised here. You've raised a different an interesting point about performance though. You find that the slow-down is actually in addToVector; where it converts a String to byte[]? The thing is; the corresponding line in the ""fast"" version skips this step and adds null. Indeed; also passing null in the ""normal"" version makes it twice as fast for me. It's still twice as slow as the ""fast"" version though. But I do wonder whether the example deserves a bit more attention. I may not know what I'm doing. Is that a difference that shouldn't exist between the two benchmarks?"

2483,0,That would be a improvement in trinidad; but that doesn't solve the core problem in MyFaces.
2484,-1,According to the documentation in VB6 the Mid function returns a variant; but Mid$ returns a string and apparently this is more efficient. My questions are : What simple test can I use to discern the difference in performance ? I tried looking at simple app which did a few string operations; with ; but there was no discernible difference. Is it worth worrying about? I've gotten into the habit of using the $-ized functions; but should I recommend everybody on my team to use it as well ?
2485,-1,@tdiop your users will still hate losing their selection though!
2486,0,I was wondering whether anyone knows of any tools available that perform the task of analyzing one or more CSS files; determining the similarity between the various rules within the files and presenting the user with options for the merging and reduction of rulesets. I ask this because a project I am working on has reached the point where it has so much CSS that Internet Explorer (Still the bottom line I'm afraid) chokes on the CSS after page load; causing a 3-5 second lock-up in interactivity until the choke is processed. In case you're wondering: Yes; I am sure it is the CSS causing this issue.
2487,-1,I understand you do this so that GF_FREE() under the out: label does not free the acl_xattr. The dict_unref() will call GF_FREE() already. Is there a need for GF_FREE() in out: at all? I think that only is useful for the error case when dict_set_bin() failed. It would be cleaner; and easier to understand if you do the GF_FREE(acl_xattr) above in the 'if (ret)' statements. There is no need for this 'acl_xattr = NULL' then anymore. If you do not like that approach (or if I missed something that makes it impractical); this 'acl_xattr = NULL' stetment desperately needs a comment.
2488,0,I'll close this issue as won't fix; but anyway I commit the fix on tomahawk examples.

I'm just looking for documentation (although if it's an indicator to some checker like pylint; that's a bonus). I can add a comment or docstring somewhere; but what is the idiomatic way to indicate an override in Python?
2532,1,excellent alternative!
2533,0,Also; the question is why you want to move the column; the other 2 posters have summed up the how; but something about your attempted query worries me: 37 columns is far too many. If you're trying to move a column on table with that many columns; i suspect you are DoingItWrongTM

2541,1,Aha;; thanks for the information. That makes sense. Glad to hear that it helped! :)
2542,-1,wouldn't this be subject to the same bug if the server answers something different for one of the keys; like 0x86 TEMP_FAIL? what about doing a response.Read while it's not returning -1 (socket.isAlive == false)? the NOOP already returns from the loop; but the case where correlationId doesn't map to a key should maybe also be a break from the loop; not a continue?
2543,0,However; it may leads to significant performance degradation
2544,0,How many sockets on this board? It's really best to stop using this setting; as it makes no sense. Coreboot will adapt if only one CPU is loaded. But why limit a given build for a board to one CPU? Any reason?
2545,-1,No; because this file and this macro is also used from plain C code; which only accepts this form of casting. Adding #ifdefs just for this purpose does not seem useful.

2548,0,I can think of scenarios where initial sealing might be desirable until inheritance is required. I have some libraries that make use of the implied 'sealed' knowledge to optimise some dynamic (run-time) processing (e.g. the knowledge that there is never going to be a derived class).

2566,0,I'm looking through DateTools now and can't help but want to clean it up some.  One thing I see that is odd is the use of a Calendar in timeToString(long;resolution).  The first two lines look like this right now: {code} calInstance.setTimeInMillis(round(time; resolution)); Date date = calInstance.getTime(); {code}  Instead; it can simply be: {code} Date date = new Date(round(time; resolution)); {code}.  Secondly... I think a good deal of logic can be cleaned up in the other methods instead of a bunch of if-else statements that is a bad code smell.  Most of the logic of 3 of those methods could be put into Resolution and be made tighter.
2567,1,Committed revision 728746. Thanks Shai!
2568,0,Perhaps you could deserialise the byte array using a known encoding and ensure that (a) it doesn't throw any exceptions; and (b) deserialises to the original string. It seems that from your description of the scenario; you may not have the original string readily available. Might there be a way to create it?

This normally causes a lot of stress and compromises in order to meet the deadline. If a development organisation has never experienced project crunch; it would be a big surprise to me. Therefore I think this is a neat way of locking into a some shared pain and suggesting agile techniques as a load-levelling technique should provoke some interest that can lead onto a more complete discussion of the methodology(s)."

Now; I'm really worried since it's running multiple webservers. Issue - The application generates unique ids for session management and maintains it locally. Now; if a user goes to webservers-a and creates A unique id and then in the next request goes to webservers-b he will be invalidated because the unique id created for him will be local to webservers-a. How can I fix this issue?

2642,1,"I thought a little about this. Basically it should work like this:  ImageName is null: there's no friendly name for the image; use the ImageId to list/display the image.  ImageName is not null: there's a friendly name specified for the image but since it can be duplicated (it's not guaranteed to be unique); then we should also give an hint about which image it is (at the moment that's done reporting the initial part of ImageId; just as git does with short hashes).  Now considering this last case if we set ImageName = ImageId; then the displayed name would be something like ""myisoimagename.iso (myisoim)"".  Please let me know if you have a better idea on how to handle this all.  Anyway (beside the image name displaying) I think that the safest way to address this now is not to set an ImageName since in fact there's not an additional friendly name to set."

2648,1,"1. My feeling is that ""if (file.lastModified() < now + ACCESS_TIME_RESOLUTION)"" is not necessary; since the lastModified value will already be truncated to the system resolution; but I do not think it is harmful.  2. I chose to throw exception only if file.canWrite; because I was trying to minimise the impact of the change. It's not clear to me whether setLastModified might work when !file.canWrite. However; it certainly must work (because of GC) if file.canWrite. I would consider moving the canWrite test outside of the setLastModified call; similar to getRecordIfStored; it just wasn't necessary to fix the immediate problem.  3. Well; not swallowed exactly; but caught and converted to failure return code (-1) e.g. see BLOBInDataStore.getSize. In any case; the javadoc for Property.getLength/getLengths documents -1 as a possible ""failure"" return code; so it had to be tested. I think if Property.getLength/getLengths throws an exception; that is already correctly handled.  Thanks for the quick response.  "

Use mvn dependency:tree to see if you really have them all correctly; if you are getting them right too:  mvn dependency:tree -Dxmlrpc.version=3.1.1  (Yeap; apparently I uploaded the pom after testing it against 3.1; not 3.1.1)  yc

Example: A.csproj is a project that uses MSBuild tasks that are implemented in BuildEnv.csproj.

2706,0,Actually; I realized late last night that it probably didn't make sense to specify the damage using frects; since the damage is defined on pixel boundaries (I was originally thinking frect because sourceCrop is a frect; but that's not exactly analagous). I think this should be hwc_rect_t. That probably implies that we should use hwc_region_t; except that size_t is way overkill and will eat another 8 bytes in 64-bit relative to this (since we're currently getting the uint32_t for free because of padding).

2770,0,Here (and several other places) you use the result of tvb_captured_length() where I would think tvb_reported_length() would be more appropriate? The amount of data on the wire is reported_length; captured_length takes into account snapshotting which you probably don't want to do.
2771,0,Does it solve your issue ?
2772,-1,In VB.NET you can; with the keyword (I believe). But what you're trying to do seems really horrible. Just set them explicitly. It's almost exactly the same amount of code.

2780,-1,I have been trying to use OfflineAudioContext and the FFT analyzer in chrome with a script processor but I am running into the same issue that this person has: In that SO answer; someone pointed out this bug report: but it is over a year old! My questions are: does anyone know if this will be fixed anytime soon and should I file a bug elsewhere? Is that bug report (that is a year old) still being looked at? Or better yet; maybe someone knows a workaround? My code is essentially the same as the jsfiddle on that SO link. It's really sad that this stuff doesn't work in chrome but it does in Firefox.
2781,1,Keith - This is done. Thanks
2782,0,"bq. I assumed modules doesn't need to be self-contained like Lucene or Solr. I can fix that by enforcing tools' compilation in that macro... I'll do that. bq. Steve; will you double check again if everything works  Yes; everything works for me now; thanks!  bq. and commit this in?  Is there some reason why you can't do this?  IMO committers should commit their own work.  bq. I didn't put an entry into CHANGES so you'd have to add it if it qualifies at all to be mentioned there.  IMO this definitely warrants a CHANGES.txt entry.  This should also be backported to branch_3x.  bq. This reminds me of the ""infrastructure tools"" problem we had in Carrot2. We finally decided to simply have them as a stand-alone project living within the same repository space; with a stored; versioned binary artefact updated when tools had to be updated (rarely). This does version a binary file but you don't need to worry about recompiling things over and over.  +1 to do this for this and any other Lucene/Solr Ant tasks."

2789,1,First: I like your approach of being concentrated on a clean and proper state handling of your application.Excellent! But; as you said: Android can kill activities and manage their lifecycle for itself. The OS may release memory allocated for your activity as soon as possible requiring you to allocate it again. This means your fragment may or may not get destroyed. As you can see in your stack trace; FragmentActivity.onCreate is called.This obviously inddicates your existing resources created within the context of the old activity are not access - able anymore. The only context that is guaranted to exist through your application lifecycle is the application context. For all other resources you should be aware and handle properly that created resources may be invalid at the time you are trying to access them.
2790,-1,durrrh; that sucks.
2791,1,Very direct question; i need to know if its possible and maybe where to start reading about that. Im a programmer with zero experience in windows servers and a client is asking if we can deliver in their windows boxes(and no they wont let us use any kind of virtualization in them).

2796,0,I have the feeling that we should perhaps split the functionality here and use a separate enum for OpenCL which would indicate the forking point if a future OCL device needs different cluster size. Perhaps an overkill now; but it would not hurt.
2797,0,Only the find_package call actually needs to be in the itk-module-init.cmake file to make the imported targets visible globally.  Everything else should be able to go inside the module CMakeLists.txt file.

2815,-1,"Out of all that pseudocode; the only thing that really worries me is ""extracts code samples from file"". Reading files from a directory is trivial; saving a file is trivial. Regardless of the test framework I'd spend most of my time focusing on the parsing bit.

2820,1,Ryan Oberoi makes an excellent suggestion; but it's a bit overkill for my small ASP.NET MVC web application. I like Lobstrosity's idea since it could apply to any class tag and its short and simple... just what I need. Both are good answers yet one solves the general question (involving a css framework) and the other one solves my specific need... I guess I should select Ryan's response as the solution as it would probably help others more... any suggestions?

I have able to everything except when you click on another button you get two active buttons and so on. I like the buttons to hover {span.hover class}; click {span.active class}; and remove any other buttons with the span.active class and put back to regular state. Greatly appreciate a solution!

2834,1,Release Candidate 1 of this patch.  This patch contains: + add IP Address to CrawlDatum Version 5 (as byte[4]) + a IpAddress Resolver (map runnable) tool to lookup the IP's multithreaded + add a property to define if the IpAddress Resolver should be started as a part of the crawlDb update tool to update the parseoutput folder (contains CrawlDatum Status Linked) of a segment before updating the crawlDb. + using cached IP during Generation  Please review this patch and give me any improvement suggestion; I think this is a very important issue; since it helps to do _real_ whole web crawls and not end up in a honey pot after some fetch iterations. Also if you like please vote for this issue. :-) Thanks.

2918,0,Following the recent facets work; I think that as part of this issue we should do the following two things (in addition to what I described above):  * Make OrdinalPolicy an enum with two constants (ALL/NO_PARENTS). It's already hard to support just these two (see LUCENE-4610 and LUCENE-4600); and it's not at all clear how to support arbitrary OrdinalPoilcy-ies that users will provide. ** Rather; if one really wishes to encode only say levels 3 and below; he can extend FacetFields and provide his own CategoryListBuilder. ** For the search side; he'll need to provide whatever will work for him (I cannot even describe here what API exactly because of the complexity)  * Nuke PathPolicy. One can extend FacetFields and provide his own DrillDownStream. I'll need to check about that one; but it looks like we can get rid of it too.
2919,1,"Bertrand - nice work. This is a great idea and the patch looks good overall. Couple of points:  - Don't forget the Apache header on the new Errors class - Maybe do the grammar corrections on the counter error messages separately? Just so we keep the commits to a single issue each. - I'm not sure we need to retain the delegating ""formatValueList"" method in TestDriver. Something to discuss...  As for using Guava to do the string join - I know MRUnit used to have it as a dependency but this was removed in MRUNIT-50. Probably not worth bringing it back for such a simple method. "

2923,1,Thanks a ton for your review; Todd. Here's an updated patch which addresses all of your comments except the following.  bq. In EditLogFileInputStream; why do we need to pass isInProgress as a boolean? If it's in-progress; that means we don't know the lastTxId; so it would be INVALID_TXID; right? So we can implement isInProgress() by just comparing lastTxId.  Because in the case of pre-transactional ELFIS; we pass in INVALID_TXID; even though the log is not yet in progress.  I'm still working on producing an updated patch which also adds testing for the pending DN message queues.

2957,-1,Sorry for the mess there; I was just trying to port CFS and Hive metastore too... but those tests don't work right now; so put it on hold; getting it to work with CQL3 Column Families is a priority for me right now; so will come back to those later.  Just for the Hive handler; please look at the (cas-support-simple-hive) branch - https://github.com/milliondreams/hive/tree/cas-support-simple-hive  All the test cases (whatever few they had) pass there and it is working perfectly with Thrift/Compact storage Column Families.
2958,1,Committed a slightly cleaned up version of the patch in revision: 1464605 Thanks for your help Todd.

2962,0,I did a review and I found the problem is not on tomahawk.
2963,-1,I'm not sure I understand your point here. Do you mean I should talk about things like field alignment and so on? I think that mentioning Java would make this more confusing.
2964,0,Sure; we could do it on master; but then the old API has to remain in 2.8. I'm working on updating this change to what I was thinking. I'll upload a new revision in a few hours. Let me know if I should send it to master instead.
2965,0,[optionally] extend SSH based acceptance test too:  acceptance/ssh/GarbageCollectionIT.java
2966,1,Hi Aki;  I strongly suggest you write a persistence system test both for client and server side; which can expose the problem you mentioned and also verify your fix works.  Actually we already have ServerPersistenceTest and ClientPersistenceTest in systests/ws-specs; I think you can add yours in those two classes.  Btw; your suggestion seems ok for me.  Thanks Freeman
2967,1,Excellent! Thanks for the additional detail Sean!

2975,-1,"> The flag package is ideally only imported in main. Where did this notion of ""ideal"" come from?  The advice I usually hear (and give) is: don't register flags except from the main package; because you're mutating a global variable. This utility function doesn't touch any global variables.  Isn't its purpose pretty obvious from the usage example above?"
2976,0,Neither is the rest of this.

2988,1,I'd really love this to work in IE. I'm not able to change the fact that tables should not be used here. IE is the only browser the project I'm working on is required to support. Here's the code: I've been using the Tryit Editor to play with this. Thanks in advance for your help!

2991,0,Patch committed to trunk.
2992,0,We could also try to detect the behavior and log a warning... but i'm not sure that is worth much.
2993,1,I have no clue if this approach would be feasible or not; but then there are two things you could try:1.Create a singleton class where you and the arraylist. The class might look like this: To access the list you could write: is the name of the getter method and before getting it set it. Else you might get .Also a receiver might start before the list is filled. So always check for null before you use it.2.The other option is you store the list in a cache object like Check for even in this case in the broadcast receiver before using it.Hope that helps!

3017,1,If you would like to switch to different network operators - The answer is No; you are not able to do that programmatically. There is no API that supports that. If you want to switch to different wireless networks the answer is Yes; read post. If you would like to check for different kinds of connectivity states - Look . Good luck; hope this helped!

3019,1,Excellent tutorial!
3020,0,The function signature for pthread_create requires a function that returns . Also; returned from should be treated opaquely. Both of these changes are reflected below and compile on my machine: UPDATE: There are some other issues with your program as well. For example; it's very likely that main will exit before your thread runs. You should join on your thread if you want to make sure it exits first. Using raw pthreads is a great way to learn about threads but can be very very painful compared to some of the pre-existing frameworks out there - try boost::thread or std::thread if you want to just get up and running with as little hassle as possible.

3031,-1,Yes; the question mentioned it won't work. I was trying to describe why it wasn't terribly important to even try to do it that way.
3032,-1,The value is having an ABI compatible way to pass the proper information to ramstage from romstage. There's no reason to allow something that can change to break in the future. Take for example the current different sizes of the previous space reserved in the cache_as_ram.inc files. Things that are brittle will break. What is the bare minimum amount of info that needs to be passed? Isn't it just a bar and a couple of endpoints?
3033,1,I have some questions.. (See an image for more information here: .) 1.When the animation plays reverse; i want it to play faster.. Is there any way I can do this? By code maybe? 2.Also. When the animation played backwards; and then forewards again I want it to stop at 'mouseover'. How can I do this? If i put a trigger stop between them; it also stopt when it is playing backwards. I really hope someone knows how to do this! Thankyou; Kind regards; Ellen

3044,0,For the record; while I have seen an implementation where calling on a was O(n); I haven't seen any STL implementations where calling on a was anything other than O(1) -- mainly because s are guaranteed to have random-access iterators. Even so; if you are worried about an inefficient ; you can use this code:

Let's take; for example; this function: Is this correct code? It does work for me; but maybe it only works for my compiler (gcc). So the question is; do (string) literals have a scope or are they present/defined all the time.

3056,-1,I've tried with Postsharp; but their current implementation targets 2.0; and it's getting painful to make it work. Should I roll out my own AoP implementation (I'm thinking of a very VERY basic and utilitarian implementation here) Or there is an alternative I'm not aware of?
3057,0,qmail chose the secondary MX (which is the mpls-pop.inet.qwest.net); probably because it could not reach the primary MX.
3058,0,I was originally suggesting you might sacrifice speed with the caches for RAM - but; its always best to use the best settings and have the necessary RAM.
3059,-1,You can open as many issue tickets as you like. But we would still have to add all these tests in here; and find solution that fit them. Why delay?

3069,1,By creating datastore models that inherit from the Expando class I can make my model-entities/instances have dynamic properties. That is great! But what I want is the names of these dynamic properties to be determined at runtime. Is that possible? For example; Is this possible? If yes; how to do this? I have already tried some funny ways to do this but did not succeed :P Thanks in advance.

3071,1,Ahh; I see.  :) I'm not seeing an isEmpty() method for the Cursor class.  Should I check for moveToFirst == false instead? Also; while I'm on this; is there a reason we call the CursorLoader parameter CursorLoaderLoader and the Cursor parameter cursorLoader?  Can I change them to just cursorLoader and cursor?

3088,-1,What you are implementing here is very similar to a . Doing it by hand is the only way I'm afraid! My advice is to use in your class A definition and override the properties for your class B implementation: Functionally; this will act similarly. The only downside is that your wrapped class A instance can no longer be changed independently of your class B instance. Is this a requirement?
3089,0,If so we count the number of substrings.

3129,0,Hi Fuhwei;  I was a bit worried by the big override method in your patch; so I have taken a good long look at this; but as its an area of the code I'm not very familiar with I can't necessarily jump in with an expert comment.  My current analysis of this is that EMF forces an assumption in the two lines of XSDEcoreBuilder's createFeature method  XSDTypeDefinition elementTypeDefinition = getEffectiveTypeDefinition(xsdComponent; xsdElementDeclaration); EClassifier eClassifier = getEClassifier(elementTypeDefinition);  that the type of an element is contained in the emf representation generated from the input schema.  So; if we could override getEffectiveTypeDefinition and conditionally return an XSDTypeDefinition from the metadata available within our SDO scope then we would be OK.  For the case where the type referenced in the schema was provided by an earlier XSD to SDO conversion I think we can retrieve this data; and then do whatever's necessary; if anything; to get the EClassifier based on that type definition (I haven't spent the time to dig into that as I thought now was a good time to discuss)  This wouldn't cover the case where a schema writer was assuming some types were available that hadn't been produced from an XSD;  but I don't know that that's currently a realistic use case.  If my analysis is correct we could lobby EMF to make a change so that the above two lines were incorporated into a single protected method call that didn't require the EClassifier lookup to proceed via an XSDTypeDefinition instance. Then our override would be able to return an EClassifier based on the xsdComponent and xsdElementDeclaration directly.  What do you think?  Have I missed a/the point here?

3136,1,great question; wondering it myself!
3137,1,Nope; forgot to cherry-pick that one. Thanks for noticing; fixed.

3139,0,This reviewable; and I think also committable.

3147,0,The fix is only disabled on releases prior to 10.8.2; on the assumption that the fix gets into the upcoming 10.8.2 release.
3148,0,Performing the conversion of the time out interval from seconds to milliseconds using longs in the getTimeout method avoids the overflow. Could still add additional methods to the Session API if desired.
3149,0,FileSystemView is the user file system view so it can have canDelete() and canRead() methods ..... this is fine.
3150,-1,I am fed up having to turn them on every time I open the application.
3151,0,This may fit for Pregel; but not for our Framework; since our communication is much more expensive.

3153,1,Hi; very cool!
3154,0,NPE is fixed.
3155,-1,[~shazron]Sorry; that was weird.
3156,0,Thanks Andy.
3157,-1,I don't think it needs to be set; which means it doesn't need to be in the input.
3158,1,You can easily define a comparator for a one-level ; so that lookup becomes way less cumbersome. There is no reason of being afraid of that. The comparator defines an ordering of the _Key template argument of the map. It can then also be used for the multimap and set collections. An example:

3170,0,I think the bnest solution is (2); because the UP value is supposed to be valid - it has successfully been parsed when the first request arrived -.
3171,1,Welcome :) :) :)
3172,-1,OK; so what do you want me to do about that? Hint: how about *telling us* what your problem is?
3173,-1,Well; this is a bit of an awful hack but quite frankly any C++ application which needs a way to define an unconstructable object is probably already an awful hack! And under GCC; I get the following: test.cpp: In function ‚Äòint main()‚Äô: test.cpp:9: error: cannot declare variable ‚Äòan_instance‚Äô to be of abstract type ‚Äòla‚Äô test.cpp:2: note: because the following virtual functions are pure within ‚Äòla‚Äô: test.cpp:4: note: virtual void la::oh_no_you_dont()
3174,1,Tried it; loved it. Using it right now.
3175,1,I would like to implement the same type of functionality as this application: When a user selects a table view cell; the cell animates to fill the entire screen and reveals a new view while animating. I have been trying to find information on how to do this but can't quite seem to find any good resources. How can I accomplish this? Even just an idea of what to properly google search will be extremely helpful!
3176,0,You can use contents along with filter. Try this: Working example @

3183,-1,Sorry for the huge delay Fabio.
3184,-1,It is not advisable to avoid an exception with an empty catch block even though you are completely sure that is not going to fail under any circumstance.
3185,0,Might simply be best to track all directories and close them on shutdown.

3187,0,I didn't see anything in subversion?
3188,1,Thanks for the new patch; Kim. +1
3189,0,I have used in Python with great success. However; I am trying to learn Scala. I have an IRC bot that I would like to add some features to; mostly having to do with screen scraping web pages from our corporate intranet. That requires being redirected to a corp-wide login page; then going to the destination; then having to possibly submit another login. Does anyone know of something that I can use from Scala to get this sort of functionality?
3190,0,@Michael - trying to see if I understand your point. The general idea requires extracting this logic. Do you think executeCommand() will look better like this? protected void executeCommand() {    disconnectStorage();    setSucceeded(true); }
3191,0,Have you been able to work on that ?
3192,0,The spec states that an HTTP agent should avoid infinite loops; which is not the same thing as circular redirects in my opinion.
3193,0,I've added a Theme class and a ComponentAppearance class which takes defaults from the theme and allows them to be over-ridden.
3194,0,Is this due to the deletion of write.lock
3195,0,That said; you should be using prepared statements.

Am I missing something?

3229,0,I'm truly sorry for this inconvenience; but JIRA is really strict about the versions being equal when doing an import.
3230,0,I started replacing C0 with c[0] because I didn't see a significant advantage of having C0 available. But then I saw this and realized this AI naming is used in some other places. And it might be helpful to have the I..M index. I thought about creating an enum to define I to M (to use as a[I]) but of course I to M would be by itself bad names which conflict easily with other things. And I thought it would be nice to have C and A by consistent. So I also created CO..C2 not just AI..AM. I think consistency with the previous name is more important than consistency to the variable name. But it doesn't really matter to me.

3240,0,Suggestion: so it is recommended that it not block...
3241,0,Finally; we found the problem.
3242,0,Or to be precise; a mostly equivalent set of APIs; JCR requires some modifications which would make it complicated to support the existing set of APIs - mainly because we need to carry state information in a WikiContext; which the old API signatures do not mostly support.
3243,0,bq. I'm attaching a patch which adds a second query() method to SolrServer which takes the request method as the second argument. Shouldn't that be specific to an HTTP server?

3245,-1,The minute you start down the road to control memory is the minute you start making a mistake. If you have REQUIREMENTS for memory; don't use .NET. If you don't have requirements; stop worrying about memory. .NET manages memory better than you ever could. Stop it. Leave it alone. No. Bad. Stop.

3251,-1,Visual studio is ok; but i really hate the fact that you have to go through all the process of project creation just to compile one source file. Is there any compiler in windows that allows compilation directly from directory?
3252,0,if the 2 structures variable are initialied with calloc or they are set with 0 by memset so you can compare your 2 structures with memcmp and there is no worry about structure garbage and this will allow you to earn time

3265,-1,inefficient. instead of using contains() above and section() here; one can use indexOf() above and mid() here.
3266,-1,Is omitting other kinds of completion proposals on a specific purpose; or just a way to keep the patch small (and you currently don't need more)? This kinda contradicts the use of the general type Binding (rather than MethodBinding) - looks like you couldn't make up your mind ....

3338,0,Function is returning a guint. What's the intent of value -1? Are there cases where we cannot find the DNP header immediately?
3339,0,You should prepare your statement only once; outside of the loop; and then bind the parameters in the loop. This is why prepared statements have bind parameters - so you can reuse the prepared statement. Hibernate does exactly this; treating all SQL as a prepared statement behind the scenes; though you can obviously abuse this if you use literal rather than bind parameters.

3364,-1,Eruby is an external executable; while erb is a library within Ruby. You would use the former if you wanted independent processing of your template files (e.g. quick-and-dirty PHP replacement); and the latter if you needed to process them within the context of some other Ruby script. It is more common to use ERB simply because it is more flexible; but I'll admit that I have been guilty of dabbling in eruby to execute files for quick little utility websites.
3365,0,So yes it fails but not where you wanted it to.
3366,0,I can't understand where the extra bits are coming from in this article about s-boxes. Why doesn't the s-box take in the same number of bits for input as output?
3367,0,On second thought; I removed the patch. This would just be working around the problem. I could live with a verdict that this dev environment is broken in some way that I'm just not seeing. Or; there is another option that avoids what looks like an enumeration over local addresses for reverse lookups (including virbr networks). Since this is all localhost testing; mocking the resolver is not unreasonable.
3368,-1,Crap; forgot to verify that this is inconsistant with MRI; it's not.
3369,-1,"I am trying to build an application that can request files from a service running on another machine in the network. These files can be fairly large (500mb + at times). I was looking into sending it via TCP but I'm worried that it may require that the entire file be stored in memory. There will probably only be one client. Copying to a shared directory isn't acceptable either. The only communication required is for the client to say ""gimme xyz"" and the server to send it (and whatever it takes to ensure this happens correctly). Any suggestions?"
3370,0,Eventually I decided to include just one patch file (instead of code and test) since it was simpler after all.
3371,1,"The patch looks good; and so do the tests.  Thanks.  My only question is why were the following lines added to setup? {code} conf.set(YarnConfiguration.NM_LOCAL_DIRS; ""file:///bin/echo""); conf.set(YarnConfiguration.NM_LOG_DIRS; ""file:///dev/null""); {code} The test seems to pass just fine without them; and I did not understand their need."
3372,0,@Andy Thanks for pointing it out.  We did  not take the latest patch by mistake and thought this change was missing.  Sorry about that. But still i think this JIRA we can use to solve {code} org.apache.hadoop.hbase.mapreduce.TestImportExport.testSimpleCa

Click the triangle and select ""Flame Chart"". Once you are in Flame Chart mode; you can zoom and pan to see the digest cycles; how long they take; and exactly what functions are being called. The Flame Chart is so incredibly useful for tracking down page load issues; ng-repeat performance problems; digest cycle problems!

3387,1,I have two tables which looks like this: Each news can only have one tag. What is the most effective way to handle inserts to the news table? The Tags table has like 50 000 rows. I'm only doing bulk inserts of approx. 300 news at a time; around 2 times per hour. I assume that i need some in-memory cache for the tags? If the tag is not in the tags table; i need to insert it and set TagID to the newly inserted id. Hope you'll get the idea!
3388,0,The length of the appointments; the span of time not yet attached to the timeline; should be handled as a CODE_FRAGMENT object.

3392,0,`ROW_NUMBER()` paging emulation; or SQL Server 2012's `OFFSET .. FETCH` clause can be quite slow for high page numbers: http://www.4guysfromrolla.com/webtech/042606-1.shtml. In that case; the [seek method](http://stackoverflow.com/a/19610367/521799) might be a better choice; as it allows for paging in constant time.
3393,1,Excellent! Just what i needed!
3394,1,Thanks.  I'll look into this.
3395,1,excellent; good luck!
3396,0,Another good reason is relative longevity. db40 is an excellent product for what it does; but its user base is small and it isn't likely to outlive something like SQL Server. Of course; I also used to say there was no way Java was going to survive.
3397,0,see CODE_FRAGMENT.
3398,1,Sweet :) You got there before me
3399,0,You should see your CODE_FRAGMENT folder there containing all the required dependencies ( including Apache POI ).
3400,0,Maybe you can paste a SOAP query example request and explain the wrong behavior and what it is you are expecting?
3401,-1,No it's not - leaving the dob blank means you just choose not to fill it in as the field itself is not compulsory.
3402,0,I have two arrays of animals (for example). How can I merge the two arrays into one by the ID?
3403,0,They could probably be combined; but the speed would be the same.  We still need to write the address out first before we can auto-increment. Let's leave that to later when/if it gets moved to the southbridge wrapper
3404,0,First define an object to hold the entity coming back in the array.
3405,0,If there's a problem with items being in the cache when they shouldn't be; adding a check around the Add method isn't a solution to that problem.
3406,0,Does anyone know what the C# equivalents would be for the methods shown above?

3412,0,I'm using it to convert huge lists of strings with HTML entities in them back to normal strings.
3413,1,No worries; just run some tests and see what fits better your usecase!
3414,0,Didn't make 1.1
3415,0,Nitpick: The pointer is only set in the ctor; so it should be const. Similarly in KEY2StyleContext.
3416,0,There will probably be some additional file checks; so you'll need to patch the projects yet again.
3417,-1,You could look at using ; but performance might be completely horrible.

3426,-1,There is no point in defining those private static variables; we could just use the string literal directly in the methods. It was like that originally because the original definitions were public static final's. We then switched to methods so that they could be overriden.
3427,0,Committed the addendum in revision 1414868.
3428,0,Hi Robert; Don't really need these global variables here.  They're not used within the function. Thanks; Ghada

Then; click so it's not flashing and refresh; same issue. I just now clicked the pause button (so it was blinking); then un-clicked it so it was not blinking; and then refreshed the page and it seems to have fixed it. The same page that was breaking on a script error is no longer breaking on the error."
3438,0,Finally; it should be noted that the 'noSession' filter only prevents new sessions from being created.  It allows access to any existing session that might have been created in another part of the application by the application developer.

Do I absolutely; positively have to use a seperate WCF service? It seems there are security implications; but this would be on a completely trusted network. Thanks in advance
3444,1,Ahhh! I just made num_rows work (even though I don't need it; as you pointed out) because of your indirect help! Thanks you sweetheart!

We're building a fairly large content site which will consist of various media catalogs and I'm trying to find some comparable data / architectural models so that we can get a better idea of the approach we should use using a framework we've never made use of before. Any insight / help would be greatly appreciated!

3490,0,"The error check is implicit in checking tmpfp below. If mkstemp has an error; tmpfd would be -1 and tmpfp would be NULL.

3491,-1,Stepan; Sorry; I didn't see you comment until I'd committed the change - Sian tested it for me. I've no idea what the msvcr71.dll issue is - but I don't think that is anything to do with my changes. The fetch-depends/checksum issue for icu-3.4.zip should be fixed with my patch.

3501,1,Thanks Ivan. I'll do the changes by just return if it matches as you suggested. I'll investigate it later.  bq.Auditor will be a top level daemon; so it should own its create it's own LedgerManagers and ZooKeeper client. The only thing passed in to is should be the configuration.  Anyway we are planning to have initialization class which does starting Auditor and RW threads. Would you agree to create ledgerManagers there and pass it to the Auditor and RW daemons?  In that case; shall I keep the ctor as it is. (by taking managers)  {code} public Auditor(String bookieIdentifier; AbstractConfiguration conf; ZooKeeper zkc; LedgerManager ledgerManager; LedgerUnderreplicationManager ledgerUnderreplicationManager) { {code} 
3502,1,In any case; manually adding an instance of CODE_FRAGMENT to the front of the filter chain in your test will solve the problem.

3510,0,Right; changing an SwField; which is part of the document model during export is bad. An export operation should just read the document model and serialize it in some format. Can't you set m_bCitation depending on what the field type is? Just put a breakpoint on the SwField constructor; get a backtrace and see where it's created -- hopefully the caller knows the field type.

3517,0,There's basically nothing to clean up apart from the input stream and structures in memory... the GC will take care of the memory; so you're done.
3518,1,I found that the best way to do this was to use Access and save as a text file and then you can set your own field width and export. excellent!

3523,0,Removing onboard devices instead of setting them to off can break the chipset configuration. This is the entire reason for this stuff to be in a devicetree.cb and to make the static.c to point to the correct setup functions. These devices are always on the board and the chip configuration will enable and disable (and hide) them based on the platform configuration and the device tree.  Without this; everything would be a normal pci device enumeration and coreboot would be much much simpler... I also agree with Martin that; as a reference design; it is important to show the configuration as clearly as possible.

3571,0,This blog post speaks briefly about colocation; and how this can be achieved using AtomicMaps.
3572,1,These are nice tests. Can we put them on AbstractHasData directly instead of the Table subclass? The one bit that you'd have to keep here would be the test with the alternative TableBuilder.

3605,1,excellent - thanks guys!
3606,0,Actually; Flash is not always slow and it doesn't always take all that much code.
3607,-1,Sorry it took so long to drag this up.  I think the issue I had was with the Customer => BillingInfo and Customer => ShippingInfo relationships.  BillingInfo and ShippingInfo each inherit from Address.  IIRC; a runtime relationship was being created for Customer => Address; which was messing things up. I'll have to dig through the SVN history to see what I did with mandatory relationships that I mentioned being problematic in the initial bug submission.
3608,0,You don't see '>' replaced because that's not required in this case (though some frameworks do it anyway).
3609,0,I think !S_ISREG is too broad. If the filename is a symlink; then don't we want to be able to open it? The original code tested for S_ISDIR; which might well be best. I just wanted us to consider whether there were other things for which to test.

3615,1,We use Xceed's 3.0 DataGrid (pro version..but free version is excellent) more extensively than probably anybody. It has the flexibility to handle more things than the other grids.. in my opinion of course. Try them all; there are limitations to each.

3618,0,Take a look at . Bear in mind that running both side by side is not supported by Microsoft () and there's no guarantee that they will work absolutely fine side by side - a Windows Update could easily break something and sometimes people find conditional comments don't work properly amongst other things. All I can suggest is you give it a go and see how you get on.
3619,-1,Weird.
3620,0,My theory of this test: count goes to zero because the delegates go far enough out of bounds to be destroyed.  But because of the easing formula; you have to flick harder to make them go that far out of bounds now.

3627,1,I've used BeautifulSoup for such things in the past with great success.
3628,0,How to check a popup menu item?
3629,0,While your basic point is correct; the code you've shown is much slower than the two versions given in the question: Afaik; you get four `int` in one cache line; that means on average you get a latency of less than 30 cycles to load the data (not considering prefetching); you have conditional jumps in your loop (modern architectures hate mispredicting those); so you get much; much more than a cycle for each loop iteration. I'd wager; your swap will take at least 100 to 200 cycles; probably more; but that heavily depends on the numbers you are swapping (how many mispredictions are made).

3654,1,Hi Barney; I think @EdMorton 's answer is pretty pretty more powerful than my comment!
3655,1,I have an old friend who is a mathematician. He has his own math to compress his formulas; which are incredibly beautiful. He works in a program called Mathematica; which transforms the formulas for 3D-shapes. I wonder if it is possible to obtain these figures using Canvas and JavaScript? See attached formula and figure. I know little of this myself. But I would be delighted if some one could show me an example.

3663,0,Here is an example in Java.
3664,0,Effectively what needs to happen is that changes I have marked as live or stable needs to be merged with the Live website. This effectively means I don't have to worry about accidently copying over files and if something goes wrong it could be reverted to the previous version again. I'll investigate post_commit hook but I'll have to find a way to do a backup first so that a problem with subversiondoesn't kill the site.

3684,-1,I have a VB.NET MDI WinForms app. My users have been complaining about form creep (as they call it); this is where each time you open a specific form within the main MDI window it opens slightly below and to the right of the location it loaded previously - i.e. it starts in the top left of the window and works its way down to the bottom right. I have to agree with them that this is extremely irritating; is there any way to prevent this? The code to load the forms is: I can address this somewhat by setting the forms start-up positions to 'Manual' but then they just open directly on top of each other in the top left of the screen. Any other SO users come across this?

3686,0,"There does not appear to be a file called ""site-logo-white.png"" in the master HEAD. Rather; each theme defines its own logo under htdocs/theme/{themename}/static/images/site-logo.png . This file may be dark or light depending on the color of the theme.  Hm... the skins patch added the site-logo-small-white.png file to the ""raw"" theme for this specific purpose. BUT; depending on the theme used on the page; the corresponding site-logo-small.png will not necessarily have dark text. On a dark-background theme; site-logo-small.png and site-logo.png will themselves have light text.  Unfortunately; it looks like what we need is a total of six files:  1. site-logo.png: Used in normal page headers  2. site-logo-light.png: Used on skinned Pages with ""light text logo""  3. site-logo-dark.png: Used on skinned Pages with ""dark text logo""  4. site-logo-small.png: Used in microheaders pages  5. site-logo-small-light.png: skinned; light text; micro-header pages  6. site-logo-small-dark.png: skinned; dark text; micro-header pages  In most cases site-logo.png will be a copy of site-logo-light.png or site-logo-dark.png; likewise for site-logo-small.png."

3712,-1,-5 votes?? People who have downvoted this answer should have specified the reason for doing so as well.
3713,0,If you're really worried about string/character size; have you thought about compressing them? That would automatically reduce the string to it's 'minimal' encoding. It's a layer of headache; especially if you want to do it in memory; and there are plenty of cases in which it wouldn't buy you anything; but encoding; especially; tend to be too general purpose to the level of compactness you seem to be aiming for.

3750,0,Oleg;  I agree; it does seem that the presence of the Proxy-Authorization header on the already authenticated connection causes re-authentication.  So; for NTLM to work the proxy-auth header must be removed once authenticated.  I don't think either patch 2 or 3 handles this case; unless (in the case of patch 2) the host also uses NTLM.  What we really need is a way to remove NTLM headers after the authentication has succeeded.  Mike
3751,1,Wow; great link!
3752,0,You can simply use here $GLOBALS['TYPO3_LOADED_EXT'] It is initialized in the bootstrap. Basically this global does not need initialization. And extension could still use it in ext_tables and ext_localconf.

3759,1,Few things to make this work :Your classname FILE should start with a capital letter; Your config array must be defined as $config = array() (and not $var or any other name); Your config file must be lowercase.The config file is passed through the constructor; so class ($config=array()); you can then access and store the config variables on an instance variable. hope it helps: config file : good luck :)

I am simply trying to create a small GUI that will allow me to alter a parameter in an ArcGIS Model using the Tkinter Scale and then run the model by clicking a TKinter Button.

3776,0,"Omer; I am not quite understand ""polling will not start for these hosts""; would you give me more backgroud information? as to save the status in the db; you mean save host's status; 'nonoperational' in this place in db?"
3777,0,"Also here; not MX/RX but instead  {...; 4; 6; V; { VR }; ...} compare with ""BETADIST"" and ""BETAINV""."
3778,1,Works fine. Thanks

3781,0,Doesn't the CLR automatically release any unreleased mutexes when the application terminates anyway?
3782,1,hi guys I am trying to create a program to allow a user to input a sequence of brackets (one at a time) and check to see whether there is a corresponding ending bracket. The brackets are entered on a new line every time to aid in the reading. I've set up an ADT for it but just cant think of how to get the while loop going and the checking...... I know if an ( bracket is entered i should push that into the stack and when a ( is entered i should pop one of the stack but I just cant work out the bits in the middle any help would be loved :) //ADT code
3783,0,This patch evelvate context to fix tempest exeption unauthorized
3784,0,I wondering how in C/C++ you can implement a program (similar to tail -f) that watches for new lines added to a log file and then process them?
3785,1,The fknames patch looks good!
3786,0,I would remove the setter; and have a public getter you could always spy.
3787,0,That's what reminded me of ubjson actually. I looked at UBF and it looks rather complicated for a data exchange. I wouldn't say no but I don't have any interest in supporting it. ubjson shouldn't be anything more than writing a parser (which should be ~trivial) and then adding the logic to switch (de)serializers based on content and accept types. I have no idea what UBF really even is under the hood but it sounded a lot more complicated.
3788,0,What form of authentication does the site use?
3789,0,Thanks a lot for this enhancement.
3790,1,Thanks Daniel. We will get back on this as soon as we have the correct information. Thank you. 
3791,0,Hi Zeid; I'll go ahead and commit your changes; but this one doesn't look right...I think it's a hold over from the Mac files.
3792,-1,I don't care about the number of instances of ReferenceIndex. I want to have this cache inside BackendUtility::explodeSoftRefParserList() which is static.
3793,-1,i am trying with Jackson but im getting no suitable output.
3794,0,Is the bug really in NGramTokenFilter?
3795,0,patch attached.
3796,0,Now; I can see this from the traces too.
3797,0,Every framework will benefit from that!
3798,1,Thanks Rick for applaying the patch.
3799,-1,This is not following the style for the other source files
3800,1,This works. :) Still; I think it might be nicer to do the check and call the error page from showBannerEditor(); since that's the method that mostly deals with output. This method just returns an array for form generation; and may be called more than once in a single request.
3801,0,I'm doing an automated test as well.
3802,0,An error is now thrown if this is not the case.
3803,-1,Sorry; this new patch is the correct one. Still learning the ropes :-)
3804,0,The net effect of this is to cast base to a u32; then a u16; then add 2 to it. Was that  the plan?  And if you ever embed these in something else the results will be odd.  You need some more paranoia in your parens: ((u16)((u32)base + 1)) for example.
3805,-1,Dotfuscator community edition is not good at all...
3806,1,I just committed this. thanks flavio.
3807,0,HttpClient stock code is JDK 1.2 compatible (hell 1.2 is old).
3808,-1,You are really asking too much of the Java runtime ( and Jackson library ); by trying to make them infer all the required information about the type to be instantiated ( based on the parameterized return ).

3811,0,That's indeed odd - I didn't knowingly reformat - must have been a mishap..
3812,0,While the examples there are pretty minimal; boto provides pretty excellent API documentation; and it looks like FPS is no exception. The fps sub-package has its own .
3813,0,setPageTitle() takes a Message; so no need to change anything here.
3814,1,@KDJ It means the elements siblings whose ID's end in _dd; and no worries!
3815,0,Could you add some details about the error you get? Nothing is jumping out at me as horribly wrong.
3816,-1,Sorry I didn't use your patch; but I think you'll like the end result.
3817,-1,I don't see where we append the rewinded header to the database file. Otherwise; when we open the db file next time; it will still give us the latest header that is not rollbacked.
3818,0,I did a change to BULIDING.txt adding ${j14lib}/security.jar to java14compile.classpath in the description of how to build with IBM JDK.
3819,1,Rebol (600 Ko only) is based on antigrain geometry library which is Opensource It seems really great; can OpenGL do better ?
3820,0,Use a real GC instead of reference counting.
3821,0,For quick reference.... autoPagingContent is the usage in question.
3822,0,What is convenient for the user to download two archives to run the project (or install maven)?
3823,-1,So for my text parsing in C# ; I got directed at YAML. I'm hitting a wall with this library I was recommended; so this is a quickie. And so on. Is that valid?
3824,0,i'm trying to convert my date which is in string form to date.
3825,0,This is a refactoring from my side that sneaked in when I split the commit. I'll revert this asap since it adds nothing to this change.
3826,0,I am trying to write missed responses to an external text file.
3827,0,s/the// √¢‚Ç¨¬¶ rebase the FSP with Intel√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s tool BCT.
3828,-1,I'm afraid you cannot fetch that!The Graph API don't provide any API to do so.
3829,0,Thanks; Mike
3830,1,Ahh; I didn't know that the wsdl command line utility could generate one file for many asmx.... thats awesome! I'll try that out now. I can integrate that into our build process too. Great; thank!
3831,0,Chat window using JTextPane no images though.
3832,1,"Hi Nigel;  To expand on what Tobias said; when you change the content of a language string you also need to change its name. Otherwise the Launchpad translation site isn't smart enough to tell translators that they need to update it. See https://wiki.mahara.org/index.php/Developer_Area/Language_strings#Let_translators_know_when_lang_strings_change  So please change the string name to ""editaccesspagedescription4"". You'll also need to change the name of the string in the PHP files and templates where it is used.  Sorry about that!  Cheers; Aaron"
3833,0,An InputStream or a Reader is where you read your input from.
3834,0,The patch should be licensed to ASF for inclusion in ASF works.
3835,0,What is 1.01 binary in decimal?
3836,0,It appears to be a simple cast to the wrong type (from a copy/paste error during coding).
3837,1,Agreed. Unfortunately board-specific modifications to agesawrapper.c files have leaked in; making this a long boring process..
3838,0,This is why CODE_FRAGMENT's argument is evaluated before a single item has gone through the first step of the stream.
3839,-1,Thanks for fixing it.  > What if the author disagrees with your negative vote and writes a reply to your comment explaining why he disagrees? If this change is filtered out there is a high chance to you miss this reply.  But with this argumentation it is even more dangerous for me how it was originally:  -label:Code-Review=-2;user=self  Why? I am maintainer and have power of -2. I review a change and decide to put my veto on it. But we all do mistakes; we all have feelings? In the end we are all people. What is if it was a wrong veto? The contributor try to explain me; in additional comments why he thinks the veto was wrong and that the impact of the change is *very* minimal and that thousands of people from hundreds of companies can't upgrade to the new version of the product and all that because of his veto. Nothing helps. Why?  Because I used your dashboard template; put this line and this change was filtered out:  -label:Code-Review=-2;user=self
3840,0,Which initialize() method are you referring to? Which class?
3841,0,needs to be space around the => eg  $postid => $post
3842,0,In meantime I will see what I can do with respect to the context injection into subresources... Perhaps in some cases modifying the subresource classes with extra methods might not be an option.
3843,0,@LightnessRacesinOrbit: Perhaps. I'll leave that to the OP to worry about!
3844,1,I am working on where i have two tables like and Country : City : cidCountryidId Means Many-to-One mapped with Now i need to access the details from I created already 'Country.hbm.xml' I created already 'City.hbm.xml' Query: Query Result I don't know why it is showing this exception...; if anyone knows; it will a great pleasure for me..!! Note: I am retrieving child details from parent
3845,0,Have you declared the Bundle-ClassPath in your bundle's MANIFEST.MF
3846,-1,Oh man ... it's a fucking precendence problem.
3847,1,Nice feature; lars!!
3848,0,Duplicate of INFRA-4886
3849,0,You could flatten that hierarchy down to: or.. It'd make life a bit less painful doing XPath queries. I also added an id attribute so you can uniquely identify an activity.
3850,0,I've created an Ant task to compile VB6 applications. After some preprocessing of the source files; I start with the appropriate parameters using But when I press Ctrl+C while Ant is running; the script and my task are terminated but the spawned process is still running. How can I automatically terminate the process I started when the Ant script gets terminated? What exactly happens if I press Ctrl+C? Is my task killed immediately or is there some way to react?
3851,0,In your code; you need to replace.
3852,0,It depends on your OS; CPU; Compiler; and possibly other factors. In general it means the CPU bus could not complete a command; or suffered a conflict; but that could mean a whole range of things depending on the environment and code being run.
3853,0,It gives me the `Failed to Create the Java Virtual Machine '.
3854,0,Thanks; rev.
3855,-1,I have stupidly deleted the original test dir; but judging from the suite's output files; no output was created after 3 1/2 hours.
3856,1,committed as 1307725. thanks for Ivan's improvement; thanks Flavio for reviewing.
3857,0,No; that article still DOES work in the latest Chrome and Firefox as of February 24th; 2013
3858,0,I've attached a font (.
3859,0,The documentation here is pretty much the same; but the errors occur in different circumstances.
3860,0,I have this CODE_FRAGMENT file provided below;.
3861,0,"We can get average column size from row size / column count; so we could make it ""If column size > N bytes or sstable is older than gc_grace_period."""
3862,0,My application has a frame that is loaded/navigated when certain top-level buttons are clicked. The problem is; one of the hosted pages has a frame of it's own; and is messing with the outer frame's navigation bar (clicking back and forward navigates the inner frame; as well as the outer frame). Is there any way to have the outer frame's navigation control only worry about its immediate contents?
3863,-1,@Raubi: Which bit? It's still going to be horribly inefficient for long sequences; as it's still doing an enormous amount of string concatenation.
3864,0,"In what way? I wanted to express that this all belongs below there ""where""; so I indented it another level."
3865,1,Committed; thanks Sambavi.
3866,1,I knew about the _viemurc/.viemurc file; but I didn't realize you could map commands to VS ones with vsc. Very good tip!
3867,0,I meant the NodeName of the element (so that the path would become; e.g.; ArrayId/Real[2]). Can be postponed for later.
3868,0,We only have islibrary available right now; set by the linker when linked with '-shared'. Or are you making a subtler point that we shouldn't forward for shared libraries as well?
3869,-1,I screwed up the encoding of the stopwords file (sorry).
3870,1,"Thank You very much for Your positive review and for improving the patch! Also; a small correction to Your previous comment; it should be:  ""unit tests included in her patch""; as You know  I'm one of the girls in this year's GSoC program. It was a great experience to collaborate with You and I Thank You for everything!"
3871,0,doh fixed braces
3872,0,You can download a local copy of jQuery or use a CDN. This link has details: http://jquery.com/download/
3873,0,Is there documentation or an article on the rules for passing strings into PowerShell functions? I just trying to do some string concatenation/formatting; but it's putting all the parameters into the first placeholder. Code Output
3874,-1,cbk->mask will only contain bricks where the request has been sent. A read will never have a bit corresponding to a brick being healed on cbk->mask set; so the & is not needed. However; for writes (that also send the requests to bricks being healed); doing the & will cause that bricks that were unhealthy at the start of the operation will be marked again as bad after completing the operation; even if the operation succeeded. I think this is not correct.
3875,0,Let's look at a sample call.
3876,1,Thanks; Amar!
3877,0,etc.
3878,0,From the articles I read; I kind of get the following.
3879,0,Our users are stored in a Windows 2008 R2 active directory.
3880,0,This has been riding in 0.94 for too long.
3881,1,Looks excellent.  Really sweet.  + Where does the jar come from and whats its license? + The REST API  looks good.  Very RESTy.  There might be little nitpicks later but for it looks great.  How different is it from current REST.  Should the two be the same?  If not; how to deprecate the old? + The annotations look interesting.  Could their serializations be used in other contexts; the shell say?  Or -- warning -> crazy-thought coming -- somehow producing thrift IDL? + In hadoop/hbase; line lengths are < 80 chars (Your new classes are missing apache license; classes are missing comments describing what class is about; etc). + Is there anything we could do refactoring HTable say; so your modeling was easier?  Looks like lots of code in your Cell and Database controllers.   Should our client be taking on this model? + Can you add a note on how you've changed how REST works; high-level?  Thats all for now.
3882,0,Until there will be _real_ need of adding new Monoid implementations; I would suggest to postpone the problem and keep *your* version of the patch.
3883,0,So a simple initialization would be.
3884,0,Committed in revision 1363218.
3885,0,These two variables were defined separately in the previous version. Now that you need them in every method; you could just declare them at the first utilization (applies to the other methods too).
3886,1,Thanks Rahul!  I will take a look at it this evening. Aaron
3887,0,No globals please if at all possible. But more generally; this is a base class - please stick specific functionality into derived classes. You already did that in SlideFragmentHandler for parts of it - for PPT_TOKEN( text ); when it comes in the SlideFragmentHandler context; just generate a new child context - e.g. like new SlideTimingContext( *this; mpSlidePersistPtr->getTimeNodeList() ) in that file. With that; you will get rid of that global state anyway.
3888,0,+1; the latest patch looks good to me.
3889,0,In my case; I simply excluded the jaxb-impl that came with camel-jaxb and the application started working correctly.
3890,0,The only scenario I can think of is some a application container that has been requested to abort some work.
3891,-1,I found this great node mysql boilerplate: it works terrific! However; now I need to hook it in to my existing user table; and my key field is named userID; not simply id; and changing the key fieldname in mysql breaks the example. So my question is; where in the project do I need to specify a different id field name? I see user.id in /util/auth.js passport.serializeUser and id in passport.deserializeUser functions; but it seems it must be specified elsewhere too. I'm hoping this is a simple question for users of passportjs!
3892,0,Why does the test return false?
3893,1,http://delta.tigris.org is an excellent tool for automated minimization of a test case.

3895,0,for completness: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAII
3896,0,Sharepoint recognize file types using their extensions. If you are worried about users spreading malicious application/code in your Sharepoint Sites. I suggest you to take a look at . You can modify the excluded extension list under Central Administration > Operations > Blocked File Types.

3900,0,If tablet unloads were to use the normal compaction queue; may want to prioritize unload related compactions on the queue.  
3901,0,If this place is fixed to contain fd->flags; should the other places(anon fd) also be fixed to use fd->flags?
3902,-1,I currently have speakers set up both in my office and in my living room; connected to my PC via two sound cards; and would like to switch the set of speakers I'm outputting to on the fly. Anyone know an application or a windows API call that I can use to change the default sound output device? It is currently a bit of a pain to traverse the existing control panel system.
3903,0,Thanks!
3904,0,these are essentially renamed to ProjectScopedPayload.version etc in a dependent change: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/162196/
3905,0,Some other pointer.
3906,0,What is the point to print only launcher version; after all?
3907,1,Looks good; thanks!
3908,1,Daniel Moth has a pretty good blog post about how to do this here: Best of all it is simple and free!
3909,-1,I just hate having no clue what a file is really depending on ;)
3910,0,I've just committed this.
3911,-1,Wrong patch; sorry.
3912,0,pushed
3913,0,"Only Firefox currently supports default parameters; so this causes a syntax error on Chrome ... I dread to think what IE would do. I think it would work just to remove the ""=false"" since parameters default to ""undefined"" anyway"
3914,1,+1 looks good.  Once it is committed; I will deploy it.  Thanks Sourygna.
3915,0,I don't quite see why the attached implementation would do more heap operations; but I agree that it could be slower due to lengthier/more complex loops; a few more if statements etc.
3916,0,You could also use.
3917,0,So I'm all for a more generic serialization API that can be used by MapReduce applications.
3918,0,We are re-using the prepared statement after table t1 is dropped.
3919,0,Any reason not to commit this patch? It's been hanging around a long time.
3920,0,Well; your static analysis seems pretty persuasive to me.
3921,0,Please reopen the issue if needed.
3922,-1,Basically you've got to call the method with reflection: Get the generic method template with Call passing in your 4 type parameters Invoke the method passing in the regular arguments It's a pain :(
3923,1,"Use if-else inside scriplet based on the currently selected language and place appropriate ""td"" tags. Hope this is what you are looking for !"
3924,0,I will do this for all remaining get_top_of_ram() in one go; separate from this fam10 patch.
3925,0,The question is tagged winforms
3926,-1,Jonathan's comment sums up my feeling. In EF4; char(1) fields come across as string; so MS obviously recognized the pain.
3927,-1,Is this necessary though?  Would anything bad happen if we encode to utf-8?  Also; it looks like this exists to make sure that we aren't using utf-16 or something else; in which case we would definitely want to keep this even in python3.
3928,0,The reason the tests weren't failing is because i was an idiot and hadn't configured the queryResultCache properly in the test configs.
3929,-1,I need from document object or from a DOM element (i.e. a DIV) to know which is its window object. In Firefox I can do: but obviously in that AWFUL browser that statement not work!!!
3930,0,did you checked that this change is not breaks other tests?
3931,0,The comment should indicate that using the itk3DVersorRigid transform is often a much better transform to use during optimization proceedures from both a speed perspective (lower dimensional parameter space); and stability standpoint (versors do not suffer from rotational gimble lock).
3932,-1,Oh fuck :-) Sorry. Not my day; more beer needed!
3933,0,Wouldn't it be simpler to just retrieve the bytes using tvb_get_ntoh* functions which will both fetch the bytes and do the necessary swapping in one step?
3934,0,And sometimes; if the system is hanging; keyboard might be the only way..
3935,-1,This is in the wrong place and will cause multiple prints per class when running in parallel.  _inject_tag_mapping moves variables to unittest result object utresult.mapping.var moves to utresult.var. However the vars aren't being used so it does not do anything. The dump_results handles printing of the results for the parallel version and as such needs to be updated to achieve what you are looking for.
3936,0,"I think we should make it very clear that this is an asynchronous process: ""Enqueues a clean up of old cache files..."""

I have found this class to be pretty useful and would like to incorporate into future projects namespace connectionClass { } I want to be able to dynamically input the project name without having to do it myself for every different class! the connection string will be defined within the properties settings in VS. Any help would be greatly appreciated:)
3941,0,I think as long as it's explained in the dev instructions you're checking in; this is fine.
3942,1,great thanks! serverfault.com - the new server admin equivalent of stackoverflow!
3943,0,Are you planning on doing this (or already have done this); or would you like me to do it?  
3944,-1,Ew; that sounds a bit ugly! Is it possible for an instance of a class to be created before its unit's initialization section has run? In other words could an instance of TMyObject try to use FLogger before it's been set in the initialization section?
3945,-1,If you just want to test the build; you can suppress the lines concerning ChartFx from the .licx file created by Visual Studio. It should build this way; but probably will not execute correctly; as the license will not be included. The .licx file contains instructions to include binary license resource during build. I'm afraid that if you want a real build you have to install ChartFx on the build server.
3946,1,Committed to trunk. Thanks; Sushanth!
3947,1,Thanks Oliver.
3948,0,"If it sounds funny; I should fix it.  Your explanation is a good approximation of what's happening.  We are limiting traffic...  Any suggestion for how to improve?

3952,0,this patch adds rule for hm and rs to the core-site template
3953,0,Have you compared with `Enum.GetName()`?
3954,0,You'll have to write some utility to do this; however it is possible to do in JXL.
3955,0,Because of presence of data-parsoid; this is not a new block level image. Title or test needs editing.
3956,-1,I almost forgot; as I received the email notification on the weekend.
3957,0,refs/users/ is sufficient prefix. No need for refs/meta. We should be plural like changes heads and tags.

3965,1,I'm trying to write a batch process that can take an MP3 file and mute certain parts of it; ideally in Python or Java. Take this example: Given a 2 minute MP3; I want to mute the time between 1:20 and 1:30. When saved back to a file; the rest of the MP3 will play normally -- only that portion will be silent. Any advice for setting this up in a way that's easy to automate/run on the command line would be fantastic!
3966,0,There are some examples like this in the Java API such as.

3969,0,The search bots don't care about hash tags. And if you are using them for some kind of flash or AJAX calls; you have more serious problems than your 301 redirects don't work. Because unless you have the content in an alternate form; the search engines are not indexing your site and you are definitely suffering as far as SEO goes.

3981,0,What is interesting here is that the OOM error already occurs while processing the SOAP part of the message and not while accessing the attachment part (as one would expect). What is the stack trace that you get with Axis2 1.6.1 and Axiom 1.2.12?
3982,0,"If you give each key a unique name; e.g. ""invoices.invoice_id"" instead of ""invoices.id""; then you can use the ""natural join"" and ""using"" operators with no worries. E.g. instead of SQL is verbose enough without making it more verbose."
3983,0,What's the correct thing for things exec'd from init? I assume we can use logwrapper if we need to.
3984,0,unused parameter 'pinfo' [-Werror=unused-parameter]

3989,1,Committed to trunk. Thanks for review; Stack and Ryan.
3990,1,The is an excellent resource for locale data. From the website you can download an xml version of the database; which includes datetime formats; number formats; and lots of other locale specific data.
3991,1,You DO need to modify web.xml whenever it's needed. Especially with JAX-RS; you will have to define your servlet in web.xml. I recommand you to use Maven. There are plenty of exemple in the web to do so. Good luck; JAX-RS is really great ! Maven is also nice.
3992,0,Thanks!
3993,-1,Sorry.
3994,-1,I think you miss the (complicated) case of a conflmict between a move in a branch vs a uncontrolling in another branch => In which case there is a deletion compared to origin on one side; and a rename on the other side.
3995,0,i think by using this code you can have a limited size queue..which is also Circular buffer.
3996,-1,I'm about to hang myself with the little rope I have left.
3997,0,OK to close?
3998,0,Finally; if I try to deserialize as follows.
3999,0,You should be able to do this by adding the parameter CODE_FRAGMENT.
4000,0,This way this variable get configured in every instance you use.
4001,1,Great! I'm glad you like it.
4002,0,The Client Profile has got better (and smaller) in .NET 4 see
4003,-1,I wouldn't worry about that in pure Flash. I don't believe that is the mental model the Flash Engineers used (Flex; absolutely; worry).
4004,0,I tested the JAVA_HOME change in Linux and it doesn't seem to work (unset JAVA_HOME and launch Eclipse for debugging).
4005,1,I came across this and really liked their gallery; not sure if the script is in-house or came from some free/commercial script out there ? Thanks
4006,0,Look in WindowsLibCFunctionMapper.java for the fstat mapping - it may all magically work if you change fstat to map to _fstat64 (note: no 'i' in the name - uses stat64 struct instead of stati64 ... they have different sized atime; ctime; mtime fields).
4007,1,is probably not what you want; but is still really excellent.

4011,1,I'm building a little framework with Node.js; and I would try to use data from an API but I don't know why it doesn't work (asynchronous but ??). Some advices could be very great ! By the way; I tried with xmlhttprequest too. Thanks for your help !
4012,1,It would be a good practice to have a separate button that will disable method since it is very easy to get confused when using your program if the code for disabling and enabling this method is all written in one method named so I suggest you separate them to make the program's design more precise.Next thing you can do is to execute a ; whic you are going to mark as . After having done this you can use .Here's how: Be warned that it's sometimes dangerous to throw exceptions as it creates some other bugs; but this option won't hurt much if you're just trying to disable a function. By the way; this will really not remove the method as it will just replace it; it's now up to you to choose which method will receive this. Hope this was helpful!
4013,0,You can try use byte [ ] instead of String object.
4014,0,Just some variations
4015,1,The best resource I've found about web security with ASP.NET is the below; written by Troy Hunt: Absolutely priceless! He even made an ebook out of it that you can download as a pdf:
4016,0,I want to be able to grab content from web pages; especially the tags and the content within them. I have tried XQuery and XPath but they don't seem to work for malformed XHTML and REGEX is just a pain. Is there a better solution. Ideally I would like to be able to ask for all the links and get back an array of URLs; or ask for the text of the links and get back an array of Strings with the text of the links; or ask for all the bold text etc.
4017,-1,They all fail with the following error.
4018,0,When that is ready I shall post the code.
4019,0,So in other words; it would be a bug to recieve a non workday in this example.
4020,1,Committed; thanks Namit.
4021,0,I believe you can only have one appender configured. The file based one is more useful to me; but maybe not to others.
4022,1,i have a botton which is for changing the background image with jquery; as the following code shows it works very fine! but i want to fade in the newbg-image... is it possible to add a jquery fade method to it. Any help would be very appreciated. Thanks Ted
4023,1,Thanks; Mike!
4024,0,Yup; it does the trick.
4025,0,yes
4026,0,I saw 'acusament de recepci√≥' in the GDLC but I wasn't certain what it was in English.
4027,0,I will remove all of the debug and most of the other messages after the VectorImage is working.  Main reason to use the Logger is to print interleaved messages from multiple threads legibly.  Other reason I'm avoiding debugMacro until VectorImage is working is so that I can continue to see debug messages even when compiled in Release mode for speed.
4028,0,So; back to your statement; a 1k buffer doesn't save physical i/o; but nor should it incur extra physical i/o.
4029,0,Committed revision 1475954.
4030,0,CODE_FRAGMENT is an extension of CODE_FRAGMENT that adds a CODE_FRAGMENT status code.
4031,0,The class in Java has only two data members; a reference to an array and a size‚Äîwhich you need anyway if you don't use an . So the only advantage to not using an is saving one object allocation; which is unlikely ever to be a big deal. If you're creating and disposing of many; many instances of your container class (and by extension your instance) every second; you might have a slight problem with garbage collection churn‚Äîbut that's something to worry about if it ever occurs. Garbage collection is typically the least of your worries.
4032,1,No worries! Happens to all of us
4033,0,This way; you can create new readers for any filetype dynamically.
4034,0,Hi; I am still having the same problem with the 1.4.1 build. Can you please check this a.s.a.p. Best Regards
4035,0,I'll take a closer look.

4040,-1,I really don't know how to solve this problem.
4041,1,Your LogErrors method is great! Literally saved me today.
4042,1,from Wikipedia is excellent to start with.
4043,0,Rephrased the description.  I am not sure if you question the necessity of skipping whitespace or if you don't think it warrants a separate function.  For the first: yes; xml.Decoder.Token will not filter out empty whitespace between XML elements; so it has to be handled. For the latter: Indeed; I could merge skipWS with propfind's UnmarshalXML but one would most probably need this functionality also for the parser of proppatch. Shall I merge it with propfind or keep it separate?
4044,0,`users' table is located in newly created database.
4045,0,If somebody can better formulate my above fragment and place it somewhere in wiki it would be great.
4046,-1,This was very bad documented.

4052,0,Use FILE_NAME instead of float.

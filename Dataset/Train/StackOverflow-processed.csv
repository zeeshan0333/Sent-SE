194,1,loved all responses i picked gordons because it allowed me to do an outer join and ignore rows that had an additional filtering parameter i didnt ask for this but i was able to implement that later jbrooks solution was great because it had a smaller footprint and allowed me to leverage functions and shrees one was a little too verbose for my bigger project but still did exactly what i needed thank you all

197,1,the above code sample uses cpu until done is true how can i implement a program that loops and only terminates when done but which doesnt use cpu modern languages use something like app.processmessages or something like that to give the os the control for the moment and then return to the loop im new at c obviously using latest gcc linux and windows a portable solution would be great

204,0,in c if i wanted to parse out a string into a date and timespan id do something similar to the following my googlefu has been less than desirable in finding a way to convert this to objectivec any suggestions
205,-1,strange error one of which i cannot find any existing resources to solve the issue the issue is when using i get pointed to a folder at files naturally this breaks everything which depends on the correct folder the one my solution is actually in being given what is more strange is that there exists a unittest to make sure that this path at least has the correct root folder and sometimes it will pass and will be working as expected and then the very next debug will point to the aforementioned folder again very confusing and very annoying any ideas

249,0,USER_MENTION sure i could have put a oh no if methods.include EMO_POS before the monkeypatch but that would make the example harder to understand its so easy to get caught up in detailing all the edge cases that the actual lesson
250,0,at a guess youre probably defining your objects in vb as just s something like this if so youre forcing vb to go through the automation interface idispatch basically it doesnt know what type youre going to assign to until runtime so it has to invoke methods on that object via to do that it looks up all the information it needs for an invocation from the object itself at run time.by contrast your code is probably earlybound which means offsets into the com objects vtable are compiled directly into your code in that case you change the code so those offsets arent valid any more the code will fail horribly
251,1,are there any tools to assist with the internationalization of strings within jsp files most ides for example offer such a feature for java code however in the case of netbeans no such feature exists for jsp files with for example there is are various tools out there that assist with extracting text strings from code something similar for jsp would be great

306,0,using nsis is great i use it too but i would suggest using a packager like pyinstaller my personal fav alternatives bb_freeze py2exe to create an exe before the using nsis the primary benefit you get by doing this is your download is smaller as youre not bundling the whole python standard lib and extra stuff your app wont need and you get an exe file to boot
307,1,i know its possible to accept a list of objects as a parameter but what about a list of guids from checkboxes this is a bit different as the only name you get has to be the id any help would be greatly appreciated thanks

330,1,thats super great USER_MENTION thanks
331,0,whether this is a terrible ui experience or not depends upon the type of data collected i once created an online job application system and most of the questions were long and quite detailed in our testing we found people often wanted to enter this in a random order and were quite frustrated when they couldnt however for a simpler checkout or registration process particularly where steps depend on earlier steps then validation as you go is definitely preferred

355,1,no worries you should answer your own question so others in future know what the issue was
356,1,is there any need any more to profile with leaks now that we can use arc which incidentally is absolutely fantastic and really speeds up development
357,-1,i guess that works but id never do that its screaming bad practice think about code readability etc come back to your code in six months and figure out all the function calls inside your html markup
358,0,your variables are pointing at the same object id be worried if they werent equal
359,0,because the table design is wrong if it cant be changed thats shortsightedness and youll have to suffer by using suboptimal sql a table change is a onetime cost which can be amortized suboptimal queries cost every time you use them
360,0,i think the fact that you have svn at the moment makes this question less obvious a managers might avoid formalising something from fear that a poorly conceived process will trump being reactive there are many options and finding the right combination may require a series of smaller changes
361,0,the last thing you should be worrying about is how fast one of these is there is no way that checking a string for being an integer is going to be a bottleneck in your code

373,0,at what stage are you populating the listbox i fear you are doing it too late to be persisted in the page if viewstate is not somehow disabled
374,-1,i am trying to figure out why foundation is acting differently to expected behaviour if you look at the kitchen sink page for foundation the default styles for secondary buttons hover affect is different to what i get if i set foundation up in rails note these images are from my rails application image look at the tiny.secondary button no hover image look at the tiny.secondary button with hover however on the page for foundation the color does not transition to the primary colour of the site it transitions to a darker shade of grey have i missed some setting really frustrating me i am guessing this is a bug in foundation

381,0,the id field of my table auto increases when i insert a row i want to insert a row and then get that id i would do it just as i said it but im wondering if theres a way i can do it without worrying about the time between inserting the row and getting the id i know i can query the database for the row that matches the information that was entered but there is a high change there will be duplicates with the only difference being the id
382,-1,im afraid you cannot fetch graph api dont provide any api to do so
383,0,a few months ago the coding horror blog reported on some platform with an atrociously bad sorting algorithm if you have to use that platform then you sure do want to implement your own instead

389,1,no worries it happens all the time
390,0,i would say you should be worried about using primitives over wrappers only when you profile your application and see that the autoboxing is a performance or memory issue in my experience memory becomes an issue before cpu cycles when talking about primitives vs wrapping objects
391,0,you can add priority queue to the list its not in net
392,-1,itll work it is just incredibly annoying and spywareesque

608,0,not really you have to declare the functions somewhere visible to the caller header file is the most convenient way to do it because it provides an interface a possible approach is to merge those headers into one h file so you provide a single and complete interface with your library the only other approach i can think about is declaring the functions in the files where you call them but this is much more devastating and error prone then including a header file

684,0,use to insert data from another table
685,0,if your end goal is to add elements to your page just manipulate the dom directly dont use string concatenation to try to create html what a pain see how much more straightforward it is to just create your element instead of the html that represents your element then later when you put the element in your page instead of setting the of the parent element call

764,0,if you decide to use events to drive your swf in order to approximate different frame rates id recommend using a tween engine like its free as in beer and ive used it very successfully for frame based tweening in the past
765,0,okay i see your confusion and edited my response with some sample appropriate link to wikipedia you are confusing the entropy of the models probability distribution with the cross entropy or likelihood of the predictions it makes on real data consider a model that assigns probability to some event and probability to everything else it has entropy but makes absolutely terrible predictions on any testing distribution that isnt a purely nonrandom sequence assigning probability to events that actually happen
766,1,no worries
767,0,to add something to this cause i found it while searching on this problem and my solution involved slightly more if you dont have a browse with option for aspx files as i didnt in a mvc application the easiest solution is to add a dummy html file and rightclick it to set the option as described in the answer you can remove the file afterward the option is actually set in and however if you modify the file directly while vs is running vs will overwrite it with your previous option on next run also if you edit the default in vs you wont have to worry about getting the schema right so the workaround dummy file is probably the easiest way

949,1,first i like your approach of being concentrated on a clean and proper state handling of your application.excellent but as you said android can kill activities and manage their lifecycle for itself the os may release memory allocated for your activity as soon as possible requiring you to allocate it again this means your fragment may or may not get destroyed as you can see in your stack trace fragmentactivity.oncreate is called.this obviously inddicates your existing resources created within the context of the old activity are not access able anymore the only context that is guaranted to exist through your application lifecycle is the application context for all other resources you should be aware and handle properly that created resources may be invalid at the time you are trying to access them

986,1,great tutorial really appreciate it
987,0,in java for example the USER_MENTION annotation not only provides compiletime checking of an override but makes for excellent selfdocumenting code im just looking for documentation although if its an indicator to some checker like pylint thats a bonus i can add a comment or docstring somewhere but what is the idiomatic way to indicate an override in python

991,-1,USER_MENTION im really afraid of what youve told EMO_NEG
992,1,i have two tables which looks like this each news can only have one tag what is the most effective way to handle inserts to the news table the tags table has like rows im only doing bulk inserts of approx news at a time around times per hour i assume that i need some inmemory cache for the tags if the tag is not in the tags table i need to insert it and set tagid to the newly inserted id hope youll get the idea
993,0,there is no author tag for the
994,1,few things to make this work your classname file should start with a capital letter your config array must be defined as array and not or any other name your config file must be lowercase.the config file is passed through the constructor so class you can then access and store the config variables on an instance variable hope it helps config file good luck EMO_POS
995,-1,im afraid is not
996,0,calling a virtual function is slightly slower than calling a nonvirtual function however i dont think it matters how deep your inheritance tree is but this is not a difference that you should normally be worried about

998,1,that thing is really really awesome
999,1,excellent work on that site by the way
1000,1,i am not familiar with the instance manager but i have used on several systems including a remotely hosted server with great success it supports mysql and

1004,1,very useful thankyou
1005,1,ive found the following macros pretty useful so you can just call or from within your app as long as the header is included of course
1006,1,you can do as your app is not running and you start from an notification oncreate gets called when your app is running background or foreground and you start a new intent from an notification this method gets called EMO_NEG if you are using singletop to detect whether your app is running back or foreground you can simply set a boolean in hope it helps
1007,1,excellent points david i think in coreys case he doesnt have an access front end so our posts are for general knowledge that applies to most access developers
1008,0,you shoud use login.done not login.success EMO_POS success is used inside the ajax funciton only the success object function is deprecated you can set success only as ajax param and there is no need to parse the data because its in json format already

1013,-1,i realise this is probably an absolutely horrible way to do a query and of course its not working the point of it is to select users based on a date range and a keyword
1014,0,try using a instead i dont think hashmaps guarantee order output
1015,0,ive been having a spam problem on my site where people sign up and act extremely abusive to other users of my site i can easy ip ban them except they always come back under a different ip address through a proxy or tor so i was curious if there are any php classes or functions that can look up the ip and determine if its a genuine user or someone behind a proxy in which case it would muzzle their accounts upon registration
1016,-1,tools to automate alteration of markup code for any objective are a horribly frightful proposition simply write your code correctly the first time if you have archaic code then it likely has many other problems in addition to seo and automatically imposing global changes can expose problems you may not be prepared to address
1017,-1,by the way as a side note you should be using s statement instead of manually writing a try finally block which might be error prone and also a pain to write
1018,0,is this sort of thing possible
1019,0,cant you just use namespaces

1022,0,i forgot to mention one thing you need to add this filter above struts filter in web.xml
1023,0,USER_MENTION what do you mean by that exactly
1024,0,i just started practicing tdd in my projects im developing a project now using and for testing im just a bit distracted on the idea of encapsulation and the test driven approach my idea behind encapsulation is to hide access to several object functionalities to make it more clear private and protected functions are not directly you will create a public function to call it so i end up converting some private and protected functions to public functions just to be able to test them im really violating the principles of encapsulation to give way to micro function testability is this the correct way of doing it
1025,0,right and that code calls which one or
1026,1,excellent thanks
1027,0,pclint and splint will find unreferenced methods and variables
1028,0,why the following code does not give me the following output

1040,-1,im getting really depressed over this so i could really use some assistance i created a new project in visual studio i first created a new header file called and placed it in the header folder it contains a class called string you can see the code i used for it at the end of this i also now have a mystringtest.cpp file in the source files folder it has the following code in it expected compiles and runs a console program which will output llo reality error identifier string is undefined here is some of my code in the header file i really cant fit all of it
1041,1,indeed your question is an easy one so i answer your question with some additional points that i think help you more than the answer this is the code notes please1 dont a simple problem a real hard one if its a hw you can convince the tutor about defining the string delimited with something like if insists or whatever and if this is a real project convince the customer you dont want to torture yourself you said you want to split the string into a x matrix what if you want a matrix so take advantage of constants and the same for the delimiter hope these help
1042,-1,i asked before about pixelpushing and have now managed to get far enough to get noise to show up on the screen heres how i init heres how i render each frame problem is this is awfully awfully slow around i think my path to publish the buffer must be wrong is it even possible to do fullscreen pixelbased graphics that i could update at without using the chip
1043,0,is excellent for scripts is standard for classes as ben says think of it as object but it is much cooler in that it does not constrain you to the object methods this has neat implications with respect to imports e.g in this snippet i have to import filechannel e.g but here i can just wing it as long as everything is on the classpath
1044,-1,and what do those lines upon lines of errors say sheesh getting information out of you is about as painful as pulling out teeth
1045,1,it proved the point they are very excited about so now
1046,0,so i came up with what is undoubtedly an extremely ugly solution i took the response js data attributes out of the body tag and used the response.create method instead then someone suggested i make the plugin calls a function then call the function after creating the response data attributes i have no idea why it works but it does
1047,-1,i hate to say it but the selected answer is wrong express ships with sp1 including net sp2 etc
1048,-1,a colleague recently asked me how to deepclone a map and i realized that i probably have never used the clone method which worries me what are the most common scenarios you have found where you need to clone an object
1049,0,USER_MENTION you will probably agree that a it is not a real question as far as grammar is concerned and b that this sentence is a totally buried in the text you simply might get better answers if you make this a real question especially the first paragra
1050,-1,i personally only use the m and the p the rest is just zany in my view it makes the code so darn hard to decipher i did maintenance work on this guys code who used semihungarian notation type id prefixes on every variable function and other identifier in the code he used signs liberally to separate words it was hard to keep the murderous rage in check
1051,-1,it would be sad EMO_NEG
1052,0,i want an simple for c in linux to which i can add features easily for example i want to add a right click menu item and a related action for the editor it should be easy to extent and add any desirable functionality i tried eclipse cdt but its to much of mean knowing the eclipse plugin architecture and the cdt extension points and stuff to do for the small i want to do thanks sachin
1053,1,USER_MENTION excellent and complete answer
1054,-1,if i plan to use data caching do i have to worry about conflicts when also using deferred loading it seems that with linq i am losing control of my data
1055,1,you are awesome
1056,1,the sollution suggested over here is perfect i register a broadcastlistener on all activities that should be removed from the backstack and when i reach the main menu i just send the broadcast and all receivers call finish this works really great
1057,0,the project has moved URL
1058,-1,this seems fairly trivial but is giving me hella grief i have a module in the lib folder the controller and i get this error i know the module is loaded correctly what am i doing wrong
1059,-1,writing a stream manipulator is a very complicated way of doing something very simple
1060,1,USER_MENTION no worries
1061,0,the problem here is that you already stringified the response as json before passing that into another data structure now as a string in order to return that as json so you are basically doing a double encode and the string gets encoded.so just pass in the data once so on a small collection like this yo get a result like this if you are really worried about the order of those two keys then you can use the bson dumps to go to a string then decode with the standard json decoder in order to get a native dict with the mongo objects deserialized then further put into your ordered dict.but really your client should not care about the order of the keys and just expect those root elements
1062,1,i m using watir w ruby excellent
1063,0,this doesnt do title case where small words articles and prepositions should not be capitalized
1064,1,USER_MENTION absolutely i was never to solve this xto1 issue and ended up creating mirror images for my sprites i praised the genius who created keyboard shortcuts that day
1065,1,when using sifr on the titles content h1.pagetitle in my wp theme it somehow messes up the spacing and pushes the title down the actual flash video is the same size as the font so i think it has something to do with css though ive tried just about everything i could think of and cant get it lined up properly heres a link to the site any help would be absolutely appreciated EMO_POS sean

1068,1,i have just come across this great api however i would like to also retrieve the continent is this even possible as i can not find it maybe there is another api that is freely available that will offer city country and continent i have tried googles ajax api but they dont offer continent either maybe i going to have to just convert what i already have into continents how i hope this isnt too subjective thanks all

1072,0,for actually the question
1073,-1,hate to break the bad news but sshclient already uses threads internally
1074,-1,the answer does not establish the same s as adding directly to the ajax call so in order for jquery to do this properly i add this where is a global variable unfortunately i have to write this extra line on every single ajax call terrible maybe ill edit the jquery framework to handle this
1075,1,pretty outstanding book gives you a good overview of the architecture of ssas as well as the query language mdx and overview a good primer for a developer or a system administrator
1076,-1,i have a serious problem which i cant a solution to i need to authenticate a token in order to let the user login into my app the problem is that even though im using the asynctask and probably because of it i cant authenticate it in time other problem that sometimes accurs is that i get the networkonmainthreadexception error im really hopeless heres the flow and heres my code thats is the urldownloader class

1082,-1,i would agree except they are related and i really hated the idea of writing separate questions since they seemed to close
1083,0,USER_MENTION edited
1084,1,have you actually implemented this successfully it sounds like a great solution
1085,1,theres for a sort that should work but just wasnt included in the core referenced from i think you just pass in a function that is used to sort like so hope it helps

1088,-1,i am new to delphi been programming in it for about months now so far its been an extremely frustrating experience most of it coming from how bad delphi is at handling dates and times maybe i think its bad because i dont know how to use tdate and ttime properly i dont know here is what is happening on me right now thats not the exact code i use everything is in variables and used in another context but i think you can see the problem why is that calculation wrong how am i suppose to work around this problem
1089,1,i really liked which however you can easily translate that to the author has a web site too
1090,1,how can i check if i have listed all the dependencies correctly the is an excellent tool for checking both build dependencies and dependencies by setting up a clean base system within a chroot environment by compiling the package within pbuilder you can easily check the build dependencies and by testing it within a pbuilder environment you can check the dependencies
1091,1,ryan oberoi makes an excellent suggestion but its a bit overkill for my small asp.net mvc web application i like lobstrositys idea since it could apply to any class tag and its short and simple just what i need both are good answers yet one solves the general question involving a css framework and the other one solves my specific need i guess i should select ryans response as the solution as it would probably help others more any suggestions
1092,0,USER_MENTION what ive read unit tests should not hit the file system db or go accross the network im trying to stick to those rules

1094,1,no worries everything is easier with jquery
1095,0,anybody got an idea build.xml
1096,1,you can do it with but you should look into jquery an excellent javascript library which makes it really easy to do that plus a lot more its worth the small learning curve trust me
1097,1,excellent cool
1098,0,i mean when the form is posted

1124,0,if all you have is the guid how would you know which table it came from
1125,0,isnt it just a base encoded version of the serialized data
1126,0,no buddy you cant simply upgrade zf1 to zf2 in case you need you move to zf2 be sure that zf2 is not just an upper version of zf1 but the whole architecture is also changed.so if you really need to move then firstly you will need to remove zf1 library completely.2 install zf2 package.3 now make changes in your code to work accordingly with zf2 as most of the things will stop working once to move to zf2.however i would suggest dont migrate to zf2 just for the sake of upgrading migrate only if you dont have any other choice as this is a very painful task.have a good luck

1398,-1,is there an easy way to find parse errors in javascript code last week i was debugging a javascript problem where the first javascript function that was called gave an object expected error i later determined that this was because the browser wasnt able to parse my javascript code i eventually solved the problem but it was a painful process that involved pouring over my code line by line trying to find my mistake there must be an easier way
1399,1,i really love the one model in one model out idea of fubu mvc a controller would look something like this and the service locator would automagically fill in all the required dependencies in the constructor this makes the controller very easy to test so my question is how would you go about tweaking asp.net mvc to allow this simplicity in the controllers

1404,-1,i found a number of people asking the same question starting around but here is the first google result also discusses silverlight as far as i can tell however the only thing you would need to worry about would be setting up the mime types and providing access to the files
1405,0,my problem with boost here and elsewhere is that you can often get on without it in this case with or before a URL boost adds a significant compile time overhead had tons of files to park into your repository and to have to copy if you are making an archive thats the reason i try not to use it i know you can choose what files to include but you usually dont want to have to worry about boosts cross dependencies with itself so you just copy the whole thing around

1409,1,fantastic thats exactly what i was looking for
1410,1,agree that you should ensure that your data is properly indexed apart from that if you are worried about table size you can always implement some type of data archival strategy to later down the line dont worry too much about this until you see problems cropping up and dont optimise prematurely

1415,0,a couple of issues with your code that may be causing the problem is as not ever escape binary data prior to insertioninserting binary data from an upload into the database is a huge nono this can inadvertently lead to some very malicious attacks on your server that extend beyond simple sql injection.that being said it is not know what the field type is that you are trying to store into nor how large the image file is storing a upload as a field in a database is probably not a wise idea but if you wanted to store large images it is recommended to stream the data into a blob field.for smaller files you can them safely into fields or if allocated enough space

1434,-1,i understand its not a desirable circumstance however if i needed to have some kind of html within json tags e.g is this possible to do in python without requiring to to be escaped beforehand it will be a string initially so i was thinking about writing a regular expression to attempt to match and escape these prior to processing but i just want to make sure there isnt an easier way

1474,-1,theres always the poor mans alternative of just loading a bajillion individual frames as and having javascript display them in sequence it would be absolutely horrible for bandwidth and memory usage and of course no audio but it would somewhat simulate video being played of course on windows platforms you could use activex embed media player and play files as well without ever touching flash
1475,0,another way of gettinga command object is to call that way you shouldnt have to set the commection property on the command object

1485,0,USER_MENTION not true see my edit
1486,1,would you happen to have another column in your table where you can group them as would look something like column second columna you order it by column it will return but since you have another column you can do order by column column and it will be ia ofcourse assuming that you have a field like column but given that youre looking at having them order like there must be something in your other fields that can help you achieved that hope this helps

1499,-1,i recently worked on a product that was targeted to net out of hundreds of beta testers i can probably count on one hand the number that already had net the rest had to sit through the absolutely painful net install from microsoft minutes and most of the time the progress bar stays near so people think it is broken
1500,1,maybe this will be of some help
1501,-1,ive been reading about mvc design for a while now and it seems officially the view calls objects and methods in the model builds and outputs a view i think this is mainly wrong the controller should act and objects inside the model select an appropriate view and pass the information to it so it may display only crude and rudiementary php if statements should appear inside the view if the view gets the information it needs to display from the model surely there will be a lot of php inside the view completely violating the point of seperating presentation logic
1502,-1,basically the doctype determines how crazy ie is going to be if you dont set it to xhtml or strict youll be living in a world of hurt when it comes to ie even if you set it youll still be hating on ie but it does make it a lot better

1510,1,there is a guy who made the exact same observation as you and he has published a blog post with a simple working example of a quartz.net console application i used it with great success yesterday

1513,0,make it work with all browsers up front this will mean extra testing during development but will cause you less pain later i find its usually easier to diagnose problems if ive just developed the thing rather than coming back later and trying to figure it out along with a list of other issues
1514,0,since that link could break you may want to copy the relevant info into your answer

1550,1,what you can do here is hide the button that pushes the view that only instructors can see if the user is logged in is of type student.in the view that has the button that pushes the view that only instructors can use do the h file create a property for the button that pushes the view like so in the m the viewwillappear method of the view do the following check this way when the view loads the button that pushes the instructor view will only be accessible to the users of type it helps

2178,1,it would be a good practice to have a separate button that will disable method since it is very easy to get confused when using your program if the code for disabling and enabling this method is all written in one method named so i suggest you separate them to make the programs design more precise.next thing you can do is to execute a whic you are going to mark as after having done this you can use heres how be warned that its sometimes dangerous to throw exceptions as it creates some other bugs but this option wont hurt much if youre just trying to disable a function by the way this will really not remove the method as it will just replace it its now up to you to choose which method will receive this hope this was helpful

2211,0,i think thats absolutely terrible practice first of all you do not need to make the trip to the server to hide and show controls unless you need new data second any decent javascript framework will allow you to hide show controls based on the controls id class name or whatever css selector moreover using a javascript to a generic handler will give you the data that you need without the postback id suggest using jquery or some other alternative

2231,0,not really no i basically just took jaredpars word for it that the threadid would be reasonably stable used this during testing and then changed the interface to react to onmousemove events instead for the final deployment i didnt do that originally because it means passing events up through a whole chain of controls and is generally just a pain in the ass it is however more reliable than the above method which only failed once or twice during the whole of testing but did fail

2290,-1,USER_MENTION if you want to create the object on the heap now and delete it after execution in an other thread i should probably remind you of raii very bad programming style or do you want to make some silly synchronisation to ensure the data is
2291,0,i think the first approach is ok but you have to be sure to always have branch b updated with the new changes introduced in branch a otherwise if you dont keep them synchronized these branches will diverge and merging them back on trunk will be a really pain svn merges are ok if you do them early and often

2324,-1,so the following hack seems to work but its really incredibly ugly imo as it relies on you controlling the lineheight and using absolute positioning worse it requires you to know how many lines there are in your text which depends on the width of the div and the fontsize and probably requires js to compute.anyway after all the above disclaimers heres the hack use two divs with the same text one on top of the other one justified one centered then clip the justified one.html css fiddle.of course the above code is hardcoded for the specific width again youll probably need js in order to compute the number of lines in the div im pretty sure that until this gets implemented in webkit you probably wont find an elegant solution for your problem
2325,-1,that is not about programing
2326,-1,yes these queries are horrible do a regular join instead
2327,-1,its very painful to add multiple tickets to trac or to have it as your own todo list that causes people to use their own task management tools so tasks are then spread all around is there any plugin or macro that would quicken the process of adding a ticket
2328,0,using a inside the delegate for the textfield.textchanged put this
2329,-1,no it is not possible we tried hard and ended up reverting to the way of using a custom class check maattachedwindow well with enough swizzling and posing itd be possible of course but that is very evil and at least as much work as your own class
2330,1,wow that was exactly what i wanted so the second solution i showed is somewhat similar to what hes describing but he describes also extremely elegant triggers that would keep all the data fully sane without any external code sanitization i think i will go with that design
2331,1,that worked excellent how can i make my xaxis go longer to right so it makes the chart bigger
2332,0,the main view is set in the applications info.plist with the key
2333,0,so this answer only shows a of achieving ioc rather than explaining the concept is that right
2334,-1,does anyone commit qt to their own source control if so how do you do it do you commit the whole qt directory or do you pick only the ones that your application needs how do you handle the case when new qt version comes out im asking because im trying to setup build automation and qt moc is a bit of a pain and just wondering how people handle committing party library in general
2335,1,wow great thanks i didnt know this one existed
2336,-1,unless there is a very valid reason passwords should hashed hashes result in fixed length strings there is not space argument to make unless the system is storing the actual password which is arguably a terrible idea
2337,0,im new to flash but want to create a nice video for a product it takes a long time to make a nice looking presentation and im hoping for a jump start are there any good templates which are free on the internet where i can quickly change the text in for example to make my video ive tried looking in google and there are too many websites many of which look gimmicky any recommendations a video like this one would be amazing
2338,-1,you can set the document.domain but if i remember correctly a few browsers opera will not even allow this i am afraid your answer is to create some sort of proxy on the subdomain that you can talk through
2339,-1,thats what i was thinking but i am afraid it will bring confusion to the structure i will need to add set children field to parent class which should not be used anywhere in the code only for hibernate cascade deletion do you think it is ok
2340,0,why do you hate photoshop
2341,1,i used excellibrary with very great results until now it support excel or lower versions
2342,0,USER_MENTION whats so horrible with using ajax and query string to update parts of a page
2343,1,USER_MENTION im happy that my solution suits your needs EMO_POS please accept my answer if it really helped you out good luck with your game EMO_POS
2344,0,ok now it is and you should never use in order to parse a json string because you would be exposing your code to code injection use instead
2345,0,i think jon probably cleared the code for you
2346,1,apples mapcallouts code sample demonstrates how do do this with the callout and their weather map sample shows how to do custom annotation views there documentation is really excellent and these samples are both helpful
2347,1,great links thanks for your work
2348,1,i cannot recommend higher than you reading through the postings of bart de smet he is really brilliant when it comes to lambda his recent series covered dynamic lambda starting with absolutely beautiful code
2349,1,excellent resource thank you
2350,0,you can use the new function thats available on the file class i believe its only available in air eg
2351,0,i think i read somewhere recently might even have been on so but i cant find the question that in a debug session pressing stop in vs just kills the process and no gc takes place however closing the app window normally performs gc as expected is this correct also what happens when a nondebug process is killed in task manager does the gc still cleanup
2352,0,just that they make you list the type twice i.e list list new arraylist
2353,-1,the function is extremely annoying because it uses a prototype or something insane like that youd have to do an ampersandcall to override the prototype however you are trying to transpose the matrix not to it which would produce a continuous list like we could use an iterator in conjunction with which works but this is severely overthinking the problem lets just swap indices
2354,-1,i was getting the same error when i tried to submit a version update from the organizer what solved my issue was using the application loader found in the directory youll need to compress your app file and send the corresponding zip file i used this for my initial submission as well i just thought id try the new way what a pain go with application loader
2355,1,excellent answer your recipe works like a charm
2356,1,wow ive just had a look at the corona sdk it looks excellent a really intuitive way to build apps thanks for the tip
2357,-1,USER_MENTION i really hate passing booleans into functions
2358,1,URL is an excellent tool for automated minimization of a test case
2359,1,i found the answer it appears to be an issue with sending to the development device tokens like most people we have a database that stores the device tokens and the earlier records were populated with our device tokens from testing as soon as i net out those device tokens from my list all works i really hope someone finds this useful
2360,1,i agree with pw opal is an excellent choice it supports audio and video devices it compiles on windows linux and a few others also i recommend using the sip protocol as opposed to h323 you dont need to use ekiga ekiga is a frontend to opal you can take a look at the opal samples and build up from those
2361,1,is there a way to pattern match in so that it will check to see if both elements in a two element tuples are equal im incredibly new to f and also new to the whole concept of pattern matching in general i was thinking something along the lines of but i guess that would be too easy hah any suggestions or is there even a way to do that thanks for your help you guys are incredibly helpful
2362,1,jeffs article is excellent reading on this topic
2363,0,a database is meant to manage large volumes of data and are supposed to give you fast access to read and write that data in spite of the size put simply they manage scale for data scale that you dont want to deal with if you have only a few users hundreds you could just as easily manage the data on disk say xml and keep the data in memory the images should clearly not go in to the database so the question is how much data or for how many users are you maintaining this database instance
2364,0,full stack trace of exception
2365,1,i ended up using which met all my needs and is imo very excellent
2366,-1,thats sad EMO_NEG i dont need it for debugging i need it for other purpose
2367,1,i am learning ml can some one please help me out with basic functions in ml i just want to read input from console and store it in a variable and use it in my ml program please help if you can point me towards some example for this also it would be super great thank you
2368,1,i have images inside a folder called pics image1.jpg and image2.jpg what code must i place inside my submit button to just delete image1.jpg located here any help would be great
2369,-1,i dont understand this part one thing ive found with this is that passing the config around to all the other utility functions that id prefer and dont think should be a a part of one the the above mentioned classes can seem to get incredibly tedious anyway look up on threadlocal storage you could make a singleton config object that is threadlocal
2370,-1,link burstproject.org is inactive and seems to have reverted to horrible go daddy wall of

2372,0,try altering the request to include
2373,1,USER_MENTION excellent EMO_POS i added an answer so future googlers can find the answer a bit easier it seems comments arent looked at nearly as often when scanning for the reason
2374,1,this would be easiest with a no need to be scared its just a box
2375,0,heres an implementation in python and a port of this implementation that ive just done in
2376,0,how do i exercise an action to ensure it redirects to the correct action or route
2377,1,hi barney i think USER_MENTION s answer is pretty pretty more powerful than my comment
2378,0,my project has an object that creates a process it this objects dispose function it kills the process or tries to however if the program crashes it leaves the process running and doesnt clean up which causes the program to fail next time because it tries to launch the process again and cant get a lock on it how can i make sure this process is killed i always use the object that creates the process in a block for reference im using and net
2379,-1,sorry current output is raw html as far as i know ill double check that though warren i suppose that is what ill have to do looks quite scary though
2380,0,you might also want to see URL
2381,0,i have tried to do the following it builds without a problem but visual studio gives a error when i switch to the wsp view the error is as follow unable to load one or more of the requested types retrieve the loaderexceptions property for more information no further details regarding the actual issue so is it possible to create a base class that inherits from spitemeventreceiver which can be used by ones custom list item event receiver classes
2382,-1,i am trying to change a bitmaps pixel color if its white i wrote following code but its awfully slow i want to check if a pixels color is white or not and if it is white change the color to black can anybody suggest a better approach
2383,0,no problem i see you got your answer above did that satisfy your question or is there anything else
2384,1,in my company we are currently using qt and are very happy with it i personnally never had to move a mfcapp into using the qt framework but here is something which might be of some interest for you its part of qtsolutions so this means youll have to buy a qt license along with a qtsolutions license edit EMO_POS i hope this helps
2385,1,both of these answers were really helpful thanks
2386,1,for the debate was about was actually meta
2387,1,thanks scott for the excellent answer this was very helpful here is a mod to the application_beginrequest code that uses ordinal string comparisons for speed accommodates localhost and highlights an asymmetric sideeffect
2388,0,can the nodes be the same but be declared in a different order
2389,1,this is better than mine didnt know you could do a string array for formats very nice
2390,-1,this serves me right for browsing s.o on waking up my eyes hurt
2391,1,this is probably what you were looking for its an uber awesome extremely useful app to track your overall app downloads sales
2392,1,excellent thanks very much
2393,0,or you can add the function to your bashrc to make it always available
2394,1,too awesome this actually answered an unasked question of mine how to stop people from cutting off others in my corporate meeting
2395,0,reload does not work reloading is usually implemented by forking implementing real reload is extremely difficult and even the most serious attempt isnt perfect
2396,1,great question
2397,0,with URL
2398,1,awesome awesome answer thank you very much
2399,0,what about question when is it appropriate and when not
2400,-1,is defined on the document and you might not even have a variable its a property of not of change to but you must learn how to spot those bugs by which lists errors and using is a terribly painful way to track your bugs use
2401,1,hiya working demos for you or both works fine hope this helps have a good one cheerios code
2402,1,per URL pending an apple release means apple is holding your app version until the corresponding apple ios or os version is released to the public if you think an app should be released on existing ios or os versions review the deployment target set in your app binary if you rebuild your app binary with a different deployment target reject the binary for this version and submit the new version.sounds like you need to review the deployment target and if you change it reject the binary and resubmit if you need help with rejecting the binary please let me know.hope this helps
2403,0,wont work well if the files are not after each other though
2404,0,added bounty to see if i can get a full answer ideally the code snippet that when added above answers the question
2405,-1,im trying to delete several working copy directories but i get an access denied on all the svn files running as admin or normal user ive killed the tortoise cache process and cannot figure what is wrong any suggestions
2406,-1,this is how you find the arc length given the parameter but finding equidistant points requires the inverse of this function getting from one to the other is not trivial USER_MENTION romo how did you do it i mean you can just use binary search but that would be horribly slow for what im trying to do anyway
2407,0,what will you be doing with the images displaying them in the browser
2408,0,yes gridbaglayout is really painful but its still powerful in many cases you cannot escape from it lets check this tiny utility to see it it ease your pain
2409,-1,thats very sad and the issue was opened a year ago
2410,1,excellent good luck
2411,0,i wouldve answered stackoverflow but its not opensource EMO_POS
2412,1,great question now i have no clue about the answer but ill stay tuned
2413,0,are you using hibernate or similar to interface the database
2414,0,i havent got the invite yet which email address did you use
2415,1,thanks give it a try it works excellent if you can build the url string correctly of course je
2416,0,need to do it without using any swing or other gui as background process
2417,1,although that text editor test isnt minutes it sounds like an excellent test its more like what you would do in real life compared to writing algorithms maintain code that someone else might have made
2418,0,this can probably be done using javascript
2419,-1,in general this is a idea headers are not intended to be included in an alternately namespace as was used here
2420,-1,the minute you start down the road to control memory is the minute you start making a mistake if you have requirements for memory dont use net if you dont have requirements stop worrying about memory net manages memory better than you ever could stop it leave it alone no bad stop
2421,1,i really love the idea of it as i can create a folder for my user control and make sub folder images css and put local resource file so the whole thing is contained in one folder and that makes it really efficient for me management wise but the bugger is you cant get intellisence like global resource so is it possible in any way
2422,1,excellent EMO_POS you should add that yourself as an answer and then accept it it may be useful for others in the future
2423,0,ive created an ant task to compile vb6 applications after some preprocessing of the source files i start with the appropriate parameters using but when i press while ant is running the script and my task are terminated but the spawned process is still running how can i automatically terminate the process i started when the ant script gets terminated what exactly happens if i press is my task killed immediately or is there some way to react
2424,0,some of your code seemed redundant so i removed some such as defining and then duplicating it into so i just defined once i got rid of and since you can just as easily enter the value directly.then i got rid of the whole get the latest file in the log folder and just added the content to the log file defined earlier i changed the log entries so they were done by tabs so the entry type date and the actual entry all line up nicely when you view the log file.lastly i changed the whole thing into a switch because switch is awesome and totally underused oh yeah i got rid of because its pointless to define a variable and then just echo it what you could do is in the section have it writehost the error and call the log function again so people are forced to enter a valid entry
2425,0,here is the magic this will remove the decimal places
2426,1,im reading an excellent article by paul white and he uses this code im trying to find out more about using dbo.name to declare a variable not having much luck with books online any ideas where i can find this thanks
2427,1,i am wondering is tree possible to do and somewhat easily in xforms given a xml data structure if it is possible where can i find a really excellent example code and hopefully a working form to view also are there any tips you have for implementing this im new to xforms and only know the basics so far thanks so much

2435,-1,i want to duplicate a very large table but i do not want to copy it row by row is there a way to duplicate it for example you can truncate deleting so i was wondering if there is something similar for copying entire tables update row by row insert is very painful because of rows anyway to avoid that
2436,0,is it possible or desirable to set up to behave more like for example instead of writing why cant i just write similarly instead of why not just

2441,0,youre missing aero check out URL

2443,-1,i have a file in the form if i try to splot such file gnuplot intended it as a surface and the result is very awful because the endpoint of a line is close to the endpoint of next line not to the first point how can i plot them as different lines as every line was in a different file

2448,0,what would the above be in php
2449,-1,that is incredibly frustrating
2450,0,is there any difference between and the convention that ive seen in most python code and the code i myself write is the former but i recently came across code which uses the latter none is an instance and the only instance iirc of nonetype so it shouldnt matter right are there any circumstances in which it might

2452,1,heres the current code i am using the above code works perfect in making vertical top to bottom gradients but id like to be able to make horizontal ones as well i have a very good understanding for php but i dont deal with php image functions very often if someone can help me and figure this out id really appreciate it
2453,1,no prob good luck

2456,1,i intended to post this quote it is very true EMO_POS
2457,1,thanks for the feedback it was a pleasure
2458,1,then perhaps might be of some help if need be you could always do the registry editing yourself via api directly for the association but up to you edit also read the comments there some good points eg the use of quotes for paths with spaces USER_MENTION also permission issues for registry access esp with vista good luck EMO_POS

2467,0,what about ie without the simple quotes you were putting arround the table name or as you are using doublequoted string which means variables are interpolated as a sidenote in both cases you must be really sure that doesnt contain any malicious data
2468,0,download the standalone flash debugger and open your swf with that
2469,0,USER_MENTION networking is native meaning that when buffers are used the data on the network they are pinned in memory see my comments below for elaboration
2470,0,s.kellers solution worked for me and may fix your issue too
2471,0,typically you would handle that as a post not a get and read the xml from the requeststream or there are helpers to let you do this otherwise url encoding and length restrictions are going to make this extremely painful

2480,-1,jonathans comment sums up my feeling in ef4 fields come across as string so ms obviously recognized the pain
2481,-1,why the downvotes and sniping its not a particularly wellasked question but its certainly valid and by definition programming related its pretty hard to do anything with django without programming as its a web programming framework
2482,1,URL an excellent tool for showing saving images
2483,-1,the answer with a guid is completely ridiculous no sense at all the console hwnd is of course given by getconsolewindow
2484,1,thanks a lot thats great
2485,-1,what you are implementing here is very similar to a doing it by hand is the only way im afraid my advice is to use in your class a definition and override the properties for your class b implementation functionally this will act similarly the only downside is that your wrapped class a instance can no longer be changed independently of your class b instance is this a requirement
2486,-1,i had to do this once in notes for a plugin i was developing what i ended up doing was editing the notes template in the designer and then writing some lotusscript behind it that called a net class via a dll so when you clicked the button it triggered the event in the lotusscript and then called the dll and passed the item information to it i should also note that it was a freakin bear to figure out because notes documentation is terrible
2487,1,pretty self explanatory question i just dont know how to do it ive been using eclipse for about a month so i still have a lot to learn im using the newest version of eclipse juno and need to push the app or email it to my mytouch how would i do it from eclipse as that is the way i would prefer if i should just email it would i email the whole project folder or just a particular piece of code i thank you for all your help in advance this site has been so incredibly helpful

2509,0,this can probably be done using javascript
2510,0,ok i have tried this with neo4j but not with great success any tools suggestions
2511,0,edited with form submit event handler
2512,1,theres no such thing any such log would have to be programmed into the database so no worries you dont have to disable it since it doesnt exist by default
2513,0,and will make you even angrier syntax errors always do
2514,-1,i hate but because of a library i have to use it whats the matter for or are there errors in my code about using referance variable error c EMO_POS syntax error before token

2564,0,i would suggest you always take a normalized approach to your database schema and then later decided if you need to create a solution for performance reasons premature optimization can be dangerous premature database denormalization can be disastrous i would suggest that you stick with the original schema and later if necessary create a reporting table that is a denormalized version of your normalized schema

2647,1,if you are on you are in luck EMO_POS you can use select for update skip locked in the cursor then you are guaranteed that two threads will never get the same row on a right way to do this in oracle would be advanced queueing since this will solve all your problems provides synchronization und parallel execution and other benefits before oracle and without advanced queuing if you really want to code it yourself you can do it like this EMO_NEG the bits marked with autonomous transaction have to be called in a separate method as an autonomous transaction if the update returns rows it can either be because the table is empty or because two threads accessed the same row so we need a separate ending condition counting available rows

2759,1,take a look at this and rejoice EMO_POS
2760,0,one potentially valid reason to impose some maximum password length is that the process of hashing it due to the use of a slow hashing function such as bcrypt takes up too much time something that could be abused in order to execute a dos attack against the server then again servers should be configured to automatically drop request handlers that take too long so i doubt this would be much of a problem
2761,-1,i must investigate further but i fear its not big precompiled pieces of middleware ahead
2762,-1,i absolutely hate how tabs work in xcode however the only workaround i found that works decent is using the osx tabs shortcuts ctrl cmd ctrl cmd

2777,1,i know its not what you asked but may i suggest using nivo slider ive used and its excellent

2787,0,im using the theme library to draw some text which works absolutely fine on windows vista however on windows xp the returned htheme is null this is the code im using htheme is valid on vista but null on windows xp ive read the documentation for and on msdn but nothing mentions that textstyle isnt supported on xp even google doesnt throw up any good suggestions
2788,-1,i am having trouble with adding text to the richtextbox with tabs in it i have code similar to this and when i do this i can see tabs in paragraphs that start with but if i actually delete the tab then press the tab key the indentation is wrong in fact its about half the size exactly also if i tab in the middle of a line the tabbing is different also when i pull the text out of the textrange lines that start with tabs appear to not generate generated by pressing the tab key this is incredibly frustrating does anyone have advice or ideas how to work with this
2789,1,got it thank you all for helping me reach a great aha moment EMO_POS hopefully after i spend some more time in wpf ill understand why this works
2790,1,your library should be named with symlinks of and both pointing to that the library should be created using in the linker command line or on the gcc command line hope that helps
2791,1,you should really check out i evaluated it quite a bit last year and really liked it although in the end we deployed tfs2008 and so were using teambuild to get a lot of the integration goodness but really finalbuilder had tons of prebuilt build activities great support for lots of environments and tools and a nice ide for designing it all
2792,-1,i have an application where i need to adjust view position according to current focused subview its a list with focusable items current focused item must be in the center of the screen used for a tv application controlled from tv remote position must be adjusted with animation i got it working with just one problem if the user changes focus before the animation is complete quickly taps up button twice next animation starts with jump it starts from the same position as did the first one so what i try to do is i cancel previous animation and start another but then new animation starts from the point where first animation was started so user can see a very obvious jumps in the animation which look really awful heres the code so must question is how can i start translate animation from the point where previous translate animation left on assuming that it was cancelled or in a simplier words how can i determine current visible rect of a view

2796,1,edited my post hope it helps and feel free to keep asking questions

2809,-1,the other day i noticed that if i run ieinspectors httpanalyser and capture the post data when logging into my bank account or amazon account the post data shows my user name and password in the clear this is a little concerning does anyone know at what point the ssl encryption takes place this i assume would mean that any software that is installed on your machine could potentially get access to this post data very scary
2810,0,you shouldnt rewrite history rebase after youve already pushed if someone else pulls from that remote and you rebase and push youll have terrible terrible merge conflicts
2811,0,partition it first to divide the zeros from the nonzeros then sort the rest oh and before worrying about that profile first
2812,0,if you are using guids you could create a createhistory table with columns guid createdon createdby for populating the table you would still have to create a trigger for every table or handle it in the application logic

2832,-1,this does seem to be the answer absolutely terrible api design
2833,-1,the top chunk of code is not indenting properly
2834,0,before sweating the details on size limits do some math on how many images youll have what the average size will be and how much storage actually costs youll find that the time you spend worrying about it isnt worth it the storage cost is so low that your time is probably better spent on other things
2835,-1,indeed this is awful a pity there is no option to change it every other i used opened tabs to the right

2838,0,if the structures variable are initialied with calloc or they are set with by memset so you can compare your structures with memcmp and there is no worry about structure garbage and this will allow you to earn time
2839,0,added bounty to see if i can get a full answer ideally the code snippet that when added above answers the question
2840,1,there is another way as the wpf application is coded with the net framework it is compiled to msil microsoft intermediate language this means you can use a decompiler such as ilspy to decompile and view the code of baronreplays this will give you some idea of how baronreplays works so you can implement the same ideas into your own code project hope this
2841,0,could you post any articles that you may have on this subject
2842,-1,i had a memory crash on uigraphicsgetimagefromcurrentimagecontext if youre creating and releasing a lot of them you should wrap them in a fresh autoreleasepool for each iteration even allowing the nsrunloop to tick was not enough for to do housekeeping on garbage lying around from this e.g

2845,1,awesome drawing
2846,1,excellent suggestion aleksey this seems to be a common need so perhaps the scala gods might consider adding this to map
2847,1,thats funny this is exactly what i am attempting to figure out the best way to do at the moment i had thought of using a viewstack but as i already have a lot of other nested viewstacks being used i was also looking into the state tag if anyone knows the right thing to do ill be very interested too
2848,-1,is this valid what im really worried about is can you specify type and also use def at the same time
2849,0,the class in java has only two data members a reference to an array and a you need anyway if you dont use an so the only advantage to not using an is saving one object allocation which is unlikely ever to be a big deal if youre creating and disposing of many many instances of your container class and by extension your instance every second you might have a slight problem with garbage collection thats something to worry about if it ever occurs garbage collection is typically the least of your worries
2850,0,those official guidelines are for developing class libraries and only apply to the elements not the private ones
2851,0,i try and but it doesnt work
2852,0,i always try to avoid to return string literals because i fear they arent defined outside of the function but im not sure if this is the case lets take for example this function is this correct code it does work for me but maybe it only works for my compiler gcc so the question is do string literals have a scope or are they all the time
2853,1,thanks so much for the excellent answers all answers worked beautifully

2859,-1,i have run into this too it is very annoying heres why it might be happening the width of your li items plus any margins is more than the width of maincontainer that means the last li item spills over maincontainer and the script will want to move that last bit in leaving an extra click one way to check this assign an id to the last li and make the width less and see if that doesnt fix it if so you need to make the maincontainer wider
2860,-1,james the stack trace under that is just my function name nothing more very frustrating EMO_NEG
2861,-1,nope doesnt fix it im afraid
2862,1,awesome this approach will work thanks btw ive followed your blog for quite some time thanks

2874,-1,i have a somewhat complicated issue i have a grid defined using the struts2jquery grid plugin one of the columns has a custom formatter that calls a javascript function to put a button into that column note i absolutely hate doing it that way the point of the button is to open up a dialog box this dialog box contains a checkboxlist which cant be rendered in the grid somehow i need to pass a parameter to the action that returns the view that will be displayed inside the dialog since this is somewhat complex here is the code grid definition javascript custom formatter dialog definition remote manage roles jsp trimmed EMO_NEG since i get the id of the grid object via javascript but use the jsp taglib for the dialog how can i pass the id around

2887,0,USER_MENTION on what line are you getting a nullreferenceexception
2888,0,what technologies are you using you can write direct to word docx as its basically just a zip file with xml in it in an awful and poorly documented format but never mind if youre using the older binary format then it all depends on which tool youre using to write to document
2889,0,you could try using the html tag instead of a link or a submit button for example the tag is much easier to style than the standard there are some crossbrowser quirks but they are not insurmountable a really great article about the use of can be found at particletree
2890,-1,USER_MENTION no its not an implementation detail it makes it a pain when youve been given an integer in natural base i.e and you need to use it with the calendar api

2958,0,i would suggest renaming the file in the repository from config.php to config.php.sample this is the file that you would edit to change the default options for deployment either to your development environment or to the production server you would copy config.php.sample to config.php and edit it without worrying about future conflicts

2968,-1,sad that you had to preface with reasons for doing this aside in order to prevent a flame war or such
2969,0,if you are really worried about memory you can put those images in a global image or your custom object array instead of putting it in a local variable take a global variable use timer i.e settimeout to check if the din contains img tag with class if it does not find any matching element and image_cleaned is false then delete that array then set then remove timer optional but better

2976,0,if i understand your question correctly the exception is because variable is not found inside the function id suggest learning scoping rules in python or read this excellent tothepoint chapter on the topic or search for this topic on the other thing id recommend is not to handle all exceptions as youve shown in your snippet heres why.the fixed code could look something like this
2977,1,i have a few months of experience with ruby on rails and really loved it from the beginning on now for work i was asked to code in grails and although i first had some objections i now think its a very decent framework one thing that really impressed me in grails are taglibs because they make frontend modularity so much easier i would really like to do something with rails is there anything like taglibs for rails if not what are the best practices for accomplishing this kind of view modularity and in essence making my life easier

2986,1,excellent resource
2987,0,you have to use symlinks instead of an alias sad there is no ui for that you have to go into the terminal and type the first path is the base path of the original file and the second is for the base path for the symlink of the etc

2994,1,for intellij worth every penny
2995,0,what transformation mechanism
2996,0,in vb.net most of you probably know you dont need to explicitly write getters and setters for your property declarations as follows vb automatically creates private member variables called and it seems as though microsoft and the vs team have adopted the convention so i dont see an issue with it
2997,0,not very good at vb6 and i would do that from the aspx page by adding to the sqldatasource an update command like set USER_MENTION where USER_MENTION and define here in the aspx or in the codebehind cause ive tried and it works in the aspx but i havent tried in the codebehind have you tried URL

3002,-1,the objective of my endeavour is to have a linux computer execute a command or maybe a local script on the target over a local network ideally i would use ssh to do this but unfortunately my embedded target is running wince which is absolutely horrible to do this i would require an ssh server running on wince i looked into the openssh port but it doesnt work and development for that stalled six years ago to wrap up i am looking for an alternative solution to using ssh on wince so any ideas
3003,0,thats what i thought thats why im surprised
3004,0,you can use
3005,0,i didnt specify it clearly rather than looking for a library i am looking for a that i can embed inside my java application so that i dont even have to worry about creating the ui
3006,0,apparently theres the very obvious client property which i completely missed
3007,-1,i completely agree with you on that subject in practice i think tdd often has some very effects on the code base crappy design procedural code no encapsulation production code littered with test code interfaces everywhere hard to refactor production code because everything is tightly coupled to many tests etc has given talks on exactly this topic for a while now recent studies siniaalto and abrahamsson of tdd show that it may have no benefits over traditional testlast development and that in some cases has deteriorated the code and that it has other alarming their word effects the one that worries me the most is that it deteriorates the architecture there is also a between robert c martin and james coplien where they touch on this subject
3008,1,i really like kate and since its a kpart other kde programs use it as the editor so its goodness everywhere why is everybody else assuming you use windows
3009,1,well i was using the setcontrolvaluetouppercase method too soon it seems so changing my keydown first if statement to fixed my issue horray me
3010,0,the point of the require_once function is that no matter the scope you wont include a file twice and redefine a class causing a php error so no worries about memory leaks if the require_once is hit the class def goes in the global symbol table only one time but aside from that yeah use autoloader
3011,-1,USER_MENTION i hate ie jquery is my final weapon

3040,-1,malicious users dont just exist out there on the internet most of them have jobs in corporations and you are probably working with a couple of them right now there is a reason that all user accounts and physical access are the first things you cut off when you fire someone
3041,0,would it help to create a view in your database that excludes the blob and then generate your dbml from the view its not too terribly different from your second option but keeps the changes mainly in the database itself without requiring any changes to your existing table structure
3042,-1,setting the property of your picker controller to should remove the focus square it did pre i dont think anything has changed but the downside is youll need to provide your own controls to take photos etc its all or nothing im afraid
3043,0,or you can use a regualr expression
3044,1,you should it has a lot of good packages i found these packages to help you with zip files for example the npm registry is really amazing EMO_POS

3046,1,wow very simple but great effect
3047,1,thats great thanks a lot for the tip
3048,0,im convinced that this is a combination of windows and vcl issues if i understand correctly vcl is using outdated windows api calls for printers which leads to these issues the problem is in windows its self but the only reason vcl suffers this problem is because its using outdated windows api calls if the vcl were upgraded to use the newer methods this problem presumably wouldnt happen at least this is my hunch
3049,-1,i ended up writing a python parser myself i managed to do it by following the spec here and then taking the code tables from the horde.org cvs the open mobile alliances site and documentation are terrible this was a very trying project EMO_NEG

3053,-1,this isnt worthy of an answer but i thought id mention many of the interfaces ive really enjoyed have been minimalistic theres almost nothing for me to see like quicksilver for os x
3054,-1,what i want to know is what does create what can i do with it what does it mean every tutorial without fail will avoid talking about the first version entirely the reason the tutorial doesnt rell you what to do with it is that it really is totally useless it allocates a single and gives you a pointer to that the problem is that if you want an int why dont you just declare one
3055,-1,horrible but linqy
3056,1,code contracts are pretty cool but they do have some limitations they will only create compiler warnings not errors also this analysis is pretty slow on large projects however im hoping this technology will evolve and eventually be integrated into the language itself its incredibly promising
3057,1,well you are really brave implementing a linq provider all be yourself
3058,1,heres a secret in the chrome dev tools do a cpu profile run after you have stopped capturing at the bottom of the screen is a down triangle next to heavy bottom up click the triangle and select flame chart once you are in flame chart mode you can zoom and pan to see the digest cycles how long they take and exactly what functions are being called the flame chart is so incredibly useful for tracking down page load issues ngrepeat performance problems digest cycle problems i really dont know how i was able to debug and profile before the flame chart here is an example
3059,1,ah finally i can solve this annoying problem

3061,-1,james the stack trace under that is just my function name nothing more very frustrating EMO_NEG
3062,0,also your fiddle example seems to be cut from a much bigger project with a lot of superfluous code hanging around i think if you are able to duplicate the issue in fiddle then you should pare down the code to eliminate some of that and make it easier to troubleshoot
3063,0,USER_MENTION what is main.class.getre
3064,1,i agree excellent update
3065,0,are you expecting to speed up the video without affecting the sound or did the timer solution just make the sound aggressively awful
3066,1,there is a such thing as a URL file which you could check into version control but it seems like it could be overridden by syntax specific settings per the URL and people would likely have to use the project file to get the benefit URL is also interesting and applicable
3067,-1,from netstat anp grep i at two different times i can see httpclient is not reusing my connections i connect to the same host every time with different urls such as why is httpclient not just reusing the same connection to myhost.com every time i have the following code for intialization of the pool that i pass to httpclient i see they are using an httproute and have localaddress in the equals which seems odd as httproute should be equal on just hostname and and that is it right does that have something to do with it is this a bug performance is very crappy having to reestablish https sockets every time
3068,1,USER_MENTION excellent suggestion i hadnt used before but that worked quite well if you post as an answer ill accept
3069,1,USER_MENTION excellent thought edited

3078,1,we could but thatd mean installing wsdl2ruby and so on and so forth sometimes dog slow is fine EMO_POS
3079,-1,USER_MENTION EMO_POS that is really sad EMO_NEG
3080,1,this works super for me no pun intended
3081,-1,dont use it i hate exactly for this reason you never know which is which and since access to first and second are public you cant enforce contracts either but after all its a matter of taste

3208,1,i have no clue if this approach would be feasible or not but then there are two things you could a singleton class where you and the arraylist the class might look like this to access the list you could write is the name of the getter method and before getting it set it else you might get also a receiver might start before the list is filled so always check for null before you use it.2.the other option is you store the list in a cache object like check for even in this case in the broadcast receiver before using it.hope that helps

3536,-1,for the record i find the infragistics winforms controls to be considerably easier than their asp.net controls i think a lot of their bad rep comes from the asp.net side of the world where certain tasks become a major pain and their viewstate usage is off the charts

3623,0,the reason to build it into the language is that it can get painful when you want a hierarchy of chainable objects that return the most derived type currently you have to have generics to allow subclasses to change the return type so calling methods dont lose scope of the object they are calling building into the jvm removes this ugliness plus instead of a return statement it can just push a reference to this on the stack as needed an on demand return instead of an always return that can be hard to optimize out when you dont use it

3640,0,in my personal opinion i would make theuilabels as properties of the uiview so option you can then access them from the view easily through the controller this also gives you the advantage of reusability from the view to any controller and since dealloc will get rid of those from the uiview you only worry about cleanup once

3677,1,wow great idea try to do it with inlineeditsupport URL
3678,-1,okay so say we have a graph with a ball on it at and we swipe our finger from to how do i go about moving the ball to this should be simple but it is really hurting my head this is the code i have so far using andengine
3679,0,i have two arrays of animals for example how can i merge the two arrays into one by the id
3680,0,one example is if you provide a custom in obviously calling wrong will likely produce devastating results
3681,0,i would avoid it for module globals certainly for variables restricted to local scope so you can see the same function isnt ever going to need to use the builtin its not something id worry about
3682,-1,well you could play around a bit what about a function that rewrites itself warning this is extremely ugly and should not be used in production code
3683,-1,how do i stop a browser refresh from happening when a flash object has focus inside a pop up window yes i abhor pop up windows too yet we have a flash questionnaire that is being wrecked from users who use refresh i also already have js in place that effectively blocks refresh until the flash gets focus and the user presses refresh i have access to the flash through our flash developer but he is uncertain of how to do this the closest we could come up with was to use the fscommand trapallkeys yet it does not appear to be working
3684,-1,USER_MENTION i disagree while the answer is outrageously awful its still an answer
3685,1,am a beginner in using ember i am working on a template for my site and when i put the template code in a handlebar its not working but if i remove it form the handlebar it works meaning i have linked the correct js and css files needed am posting the index.html and app.js please assistance would be great EMO_POS EMO_POS index.html app.js github is here for the file thanks loads shei
3686,1,worked really great thanks a ton
3687,-1,ohh well this is sad i found the error and it unfortunately just was a typographical error
3688,-1,i am also having this exact problem large table nested divs within table firefox renders teh page within seconds ie renders the table after a wait of minutes firefox still zips along with teh drag and dtop ie crawls infact it freezes and the drag and drop sdoes not work am going to try some of teh solutions below the fixed width and the id tagname.class references but i do fear that it will still be slow if anyone else has some good i deas i would be all ears
3689,-1,talking about feelings i really hate the asp.net calendarextender
3690,0,if you dont have alot of rows returned ill often use function if its lots of rows ill just do the query in sql developer and save as xls businessy types love excel for some reason
3691,1,that is great news

3693,0,can you show us some code extremely difficult to diagnose otherwise
3694,1,for a good c compiler use it is an excellent compiler which a huge device database to select from you can use keil to generate a hex file in the intel hex file format you can then load the hex file into to simulate your design and see the output
3695,-1,most of the times when iphone program crash compiler show stack with full of nos but these nos dont make any sense to me very rarely it point out where the problem might be and mostly there are these useless nos how you can make sure that when your program crashes while it shows at what place this cause this crash
3696,1,this is excellent EMO_POS
3697,0,for example how would i go about summing the cost of items so id get

3700,0,whats their max baudrate for communicating with usb converters i looked on their website it says but i may have misread something not enough for my application
3701,0,this code is correct however if we call peek or pop without putting anything on the stack it will crash as the index is this could be easily fixed by adding index bounds checking
3702,0,in what context are you asking this question database type
3703,1,for an excellent event manager class check danny millers URL

3716,-1,enumerating all partitions of a set is now all permutations of all partitions of a set will be although the example is a bit artificial now to come up with a useful algorithm its a totally different story i am not aware of any such algorithm and in any case its scaling will be absolutely awful

3725,1,reviewing the msdn docs for the functions listed i see that the function checks with the smbios table which is referenced by a standard it appears that you indeed can find the information you seek through the bios you may have to install a driver to get that information out to your program good luck
3726,0,i used the same approach as chris wenham under load performance suffers because new notifycollectionchangedeventargs need to be allocated for each regardless in the enqueue send args with notifycollectionchangedaction.add the item added and count1 as the index in the dequeue send args with notifycollectionchangedaction.remove the item removed and index
3727,-1,is search and replace the only way to rename as asp control in the code behind file i find this extremely annoying but it is the only way i can find scenario ill find a variable that needs renaming usually to meet naming convention ill rename the variable in the file ill have to go in the code behind files and search and replace i get annoyed are there any better ways preferably that would not touch a similarly named variable in another scope in the project im on vs2008 with resharper does vs2010 address this perhaps
3728,0,how do i scroll to a panel within an updatepanel after i load the content
3729,-1,we are running jenkins on a server that does not have internet access even through proxy installing and keeping the jenkins installation uptodate is a pain my idea was to make a local mirror of the complete jenkins public updatesite through a windows workstation that has internet access and then make this local mirror available to jenkins through nfs share so my questions how to make the local mirror do you have a idea to keep the jenkins installation uptodate

3732,0,ive been using for a little while now but theres one glaring piece of functionality that is either missing or i just cant figure out i hope the latter if you pass cfg.gettemplate an absolute path it just doesnt work i know you can specify a template directory but i cant afford to do that my use case could deal with files in any directory is there any way to set freemarker to render absolute paths the way any user would expect

3745,-1,i am getting very strange flickering on a wpf application of mine it only happens with alpha blended content only on my computer and only with wpf applications at least i havent noticed it with anything else its really annoying has anyone else dealt with this weirdness
3746,-1,why use a here the method just returns a reference to an instance this is a reference type whether the object referenced is mutable or immutable is irrelevant the reference is to the same object no matter if the object mutates why do locking even if the instance was not singleton or readonly i.e even if the field reference could change since assignments are URL there would still be no need for i will downvote this answer net upvotes
3747,0,the accepted answer worked for me at the time

3759,0,when we have a cluster of machines behind a load balancer lb generally hardware load balancer have persistent connections now when we need to deploy some update on all machines rolling update the way to do is by bringing one machine out of rotation looks for no request sent to that server via lb when the app reached no request state then update manually with servers in picture this becomes very painful can someone have a better way of doing it
3760,-1,exactly why im asking because thats what i fear
3761,1,there is a free ebook that microsoft released about windows phone developement its extremely useful and it could probably answer this and many other questions you might have you can download the book from this website

3784,-1,the documentation for the minitestci gem seemingly the only option for producing test results for a ci tool such as jenkins has the extremely annoying habit of not preserving the results of when invoked as the test results from running are deleted prior to running the rest of the tests minitestcis barelyextant documentation claims adding this to test_helper.rb will disable the troublesome autoclean behavior but it doesnt has anyone out there managed to get minitestci to preserve all the test result files im reaching wits end here

3838,1,thats one bit of excellent logic thank you so much
3839,0,that was i totally agree
3840,0,it comes down to designing for testability ideally you should not instantiate those com objects directly but should access them through a layer of indirection that can be replaced by a mock object now com itself does provide a level of indirection and you could provide a mock object that provided a substitute for the real one but i suspect it would be a pain to create and i doubt if youd get much help from an existing mocking framework

3855,-1,i tend to have just file but dont upload the web.config when i update the site maybe this is bad practice but i think its what microsoft intend you to do can be a bit of a pain though if you or a new team member accidentlly upload it

3860,1,no worries just run some tests and see what fits better your usecase
3861,-1,worried about ie compatibility
3862,-1,not for me but i can suggest some possibilities it may cause problem while this can be solved by using some and then this will cause the code messier some code may crash and your code success will go away from you no solution unless you know more about the code code upgrade problem if external code has upgrade you may have problem to know which is that again use and again messier so these are some that i can think can make it more convenient to you can edit more than one code at onceyou can edit some code that you want able to edit external resource modifying is more convenient.you can make it load file with kb is faster than files with kb each.it is you dont need to worry about external resource being are my suggestions try to think more about it

4085,0,well keep in mind that in theory you have the original code to help as well as the text of the log messages the only thing that should be obfuscated would be the class and member names in addition many tools dotfuscator is one create a map file to tell you what obfuscated construct name maps back to which original name this can make it a pain to figure out exactly where the log messages come from but nowhere near impossible
4086,1,what options are there to pull a gapps user creation date i saw that the admin sdk is capable of it is it the only api capable of doing this does any of the previous one also capable of if possible using gas it will be most excellent thank you

4089,-1,you can analyse changes using the tfs api down to the level of what files have changed but to determine what content in a file has changed you need to use external there is a tool that ships with visual studio team explorer but this is still an external tool that processes the changes at runtime just fyi edit i think i may be completely wrong

4155,-1,i cant help think that making xml ad xmllist both unrelated as in both extend object directly is a design flaw in the as3 core library surely having xml extend xmllist would be a much cleaner system where xml is considered an xmllist with only one member this would also avoid the very annoying practice of an e4x query possibly returning either an xml or xmllist which can result in a casting error so is there any reason im not thinking of that xml and xmllist were designed to only have object as a common type

4247,0,while your basic point is correct the code youve shown is much slower than the two versions given in the question afaik you get four in one cache line that means on average you get a latency of less than cycles to load the data not considering prefetching you have conditional jumps in your loop modern architectures hate mispredicting those so you get much much more than a cycle for each loop iteration id wager your swap will take at least to cycles probably more but that heavily depends on the numbers you are swapping how many mispredictions are made

4265,-1,hate to say it but i dont think there is a way to alleviate this i do think that it depends on the client system though so a faster javascript engine or machine may make it slightly more accurate

4277,0,i wouldnt class that a problem if you structure things in a meaningful way you should be able to look at the js see where all the event hooks are if youre worried too much about it you set the rel attr to js or prepent the id with js_ etc
4278,1,i would use pure ruby matz ruby interpreter mri to start off my understanding is that iron ruby is not quite ready yet if you are looking for a good book my current favorite over pickaxe is by matz and flanagan the book is very concise well written paragraphs and they provide great examples in and enjoy d

4284,1,USER_MENTION no worries
4285,1,USER_MENTION excellent that works thank you very much if youd like some brownie points please submit it as an answer and ill mark it as the correct answer
4286,1,USER_MENTION excellent suggestion code changed EMO_POS
4287,1,it seems to be working really fine for me ie not tested but ff chrome it works
4288,0,does string immutability work by statement or by strings within a statement for example i understand that the following code will allocate two strings on the heap hello will remain on the heap until garbage collected and s now references hello world on the heap however how many strings does the following line allocate on the heap or also is there a to verify the results
4289,-1,you need to or if you target windows phone port you code to directx the call is it will be painful you will still use this feature level
4290,-1,i use festassertions in my tests and i noticed that using yields different results than in tests where hibernate objects are tested i had to do workaround and now test looks really ugly but i cannot use because that just does not work here is partial at last line EMO_NEG seasonrate seasonrate1 are created and persisted then retrieved from db and checked against originals nothing fancy but does not work with festassertions do you have any idea how to fix that and if it is some error on my side or not
4291,-1,evaluation of what i may be being slow today but i really dont understand what your problem is im awful tempted to vote to close on the principle that i dont see a real question
4292,0,i had similar issue this article explains why and how to solve it
4293,1,thank you thats extremely helpful
4294,1,excellent the selected bit was very useful
4295,-1,i agree we often face this problem when using xe databases this is really annoying
4296,0,if you have a choice try it with awk
4297,0,USER_MENTION the question was about floats which string ends with a comma only the tuple from has a comma
4298,1,USER_MENTION great success thanks for the link post it as an answer and ill accept
4299,-1,damn thats what i was afraid of
4300,1,this worked great for me thanks
4301,0,in windowsforms world you can get a list of available image with my question is is there a way to do something analogous for the wpf world that would allow me to get a list of available
4302,0,what means csla canreadproperty
4303,1,excellent much cleaner
4304,-1,thats too sad EMO_NEG
4305,0,that would be unlikely it depends on the randomness of the generated account number and the number of active accounts with managed code you have to recurse of thousands of times in order to break the stack when the probability of nonuniqueness approaches then its time to worry
4306,1,great excellent youre welcome
4307,-1,its not one is it i have a method that gets five lists from different repositories each call opens and closes a new datacontext is this ok to do or should i wrap everything in one datacontext in this case it is not straightforward to use the same datacontext but i am afraid that opening and closing numerous datacontext in one page request is not good
4308,-1,im working with vb in the form designer trying to position some controls within a tab control sometimes when i drag a control to position it it gets placed on a different tab than the one i currently have selected and am working with this is extremely annoying and seems to happen randomly does anyone else ever have this issue
4309,0,not unless your java framework is horribly inefficient or for apps in which the db server does of the work
4310,1,excellent explanation
4311,0,that makes sense but the issue for me was that i had no way of knowing a prefixquery actually became a booleanquery
4312,1,awesome thanks EMO_POS
4313,-1,ah make me look lazy guilty
4314,1,was excellent EMO_POS however instead of creating a button object i am only calling an ontouchlistener to change the state of every view gives the same results though
4315,0,try not to reference another post because they get out of order due to voting
4316,0,i think by using this code you can have a limited size queue which is also circular buffer
4317,1,if you want to try a new and alternative approach this is a application core framework modelled after java osgi i havent tried it myself but it looks really cool
4318,1,you should really take a look at sprox it builds on restcontroller is very straight forward well documented imo generates forms and validation magically from your database and leaves you with a minimum of code to write i really enjoy working with it hope that helps you EMO_POS
4319,1,version of contains a debugger and it works awesome it is still in very early stages but have helped me several times just watch out for bugs EMO_POS

4331,-1,is there any way to quickly jump to a scene in a storyboard i have about different controllers and it has become incredibly tedious to locate the view controller im trying to edit
4332,-1,unfortunatly most browsers think window.close is malicious and dont allow it to close itself without at least prompting the user EMO_NEG
4333,1,USER_MENTION i already have a rapache implementation i have simply no time to switch to a different technology i chose this because it makes r behave like php and others which means people can start to see r as a general purpose language something id
4334,0,sometimes this piece of code returns the same number and sometimes it works fine so it works randomly EMO_POS EMO_POS EMO_POS ok ok downvote me now
4335,0,fear not the highlighting returns with the next search the command should probably be named clearhighlight
4336,1,this is very fine EMO_POS note that if you do the following only the first element of the array will be initialized with the nonzero number whereas the rest will be initialized with zeros
4337,0,URL
4338,1,excellent thanks
4339,0,also if you are worried about trips to the db make steps into a stored procedure then you have one trip
4340,1,godd luck hope you figure it out EMO_POS
4341,0,something along these lines perhaps
4342,1,like others im using larger fonts since getting on the plus side of fifty most recently i started using the consolas typeface and have really enjoyed it fixed width indents well the clear differences between lowercase l and number and the letter o and zeronumber for example also makes this a really good programming font
4343,0,seems like a duplicate question please see excellent answer for usings be inside or outside the URL
4344,0,this is flat wrong im afraid you should follow w3c guidelines URL xml should not be formed on readability or on making it compact but rather using elements or attributes correctly for the purpose which they were designed for
4345,1,excellent thanks much
4346,1,no worries happens to all of us
4347,0,why return
4348,1,thats great EMO_POS

4351,-1,if i have a setup project in a vs solution and i another project or another project any setup projects in the solution are expanded in the solution explorer it only does this for setup projects and it is extremely annoying is there any way to disable this behaviour
4352,0,afaik there are no native language constructs for this if you need it for debugging purposes i would advice you to have deeper look into the xdebug extension especially awesome EMO_POS another idea would be to implement in your class and wrap all public methods but this requires to change the code and has other side effects EMO_NEG simplified example example
4353,1,for this question i have the same issue
4354,1,excellent explanation for you sir
4355,0,jquery abuse use css html fiddlethis should be much faster then jquery as with everything css

4359,1,funny that is exactly what i just did great question
4360,1,this was a very quick and excellent way to show me everything i needed
4361,-1,its not quick to do but you can also run fxcop and it will alert you to objects that are idisposable that arent in a using block working on some legacy code here at work i found that whoever wrote it orgininally actually made a dispose method is almost every class even if not needed but the classes dont actually implement idisposable which means in intellisence they all have a dispose method but cant be put in using blocks very annoying
4362,1,nick rigby wrote an excellent article for a list apart titled uses fieldset legend label highly semantic
4363,1,per URL need to be registered as a member of a google or google group that is designated for beta or alpha testing by the developer if you are not registered you will only be able to download the production app from google play not the beta or alpha version of the app from google play having the link wont be sufficient you need to optin to the beta or alpha via google or google group please note that even if you properly optin via google or google groups as defined by the developer you will need to wait several hours perhaps hours for your status to propagate via google play so perhaps you need to wait hours even if your status is this helps
4364,-1,i currently have speakers set up both in my office and in my living room connected to my pc via two sound cards and would like to switch the set of speakers im outputting to on the fly anyone know an application or a windows api call that i can use to change the default sound output device it is currently a bit of a pain to traverse the existing control panel system

4372,0,cant you just use namespaces
4373,1,hey i am trying to further my knowledge of javascript and was wondering if anyone could explain to me what exactly is happening in the script below most importantly why are there google_ ad_ at the beginning and what is the purpose of them a line by line explanation would be awesome EMO_POS thanks for any help i really appreciate it
4374,0,if youre really worried about this java is not the language for you
4375,1,i found a library that makes it easy to get my oauth_token and oauth_token_secret with c if im trying to make a post to a restful web service ie how are those two keys leveraged to varify authentication a example would be awesome
4376,0,paging emulation or sql server clause can be quite slow for high page numbers URL in that case the URL might be a better choice as it allows for paging in constant time
4377,1,you may be looking for a solution similar to josh smiths in his article he presents the following and then uses the multivalue converters as follows hope this helps
4378,1,sounds like you are looking for a jsmin tool or similar there are many tools which you can purchase but there are also some online tools you can use good luck
4379,0,they dont leak but they will consume resources until they are garbage collected the gc will call dispose on them i dont think datatable maintains a connection to the database so you wouldnt have to worry about calling dispose or close on it to a similar question
4380,1,to convert raster images to vectorial images i found free to do an excellent job comparable to vectormagic which is not free anymore by the way in inkscape import your image and use the bitmap function it has a lot of control once you converted to a vectorial image save it as a svg then using you can convert to xaml vector data path canvas
4381,1,devexpress have a good one the rangetrackbarcontrol control extends the functionality provided by the trackbarcontrol enabling endusers to select a range of values two sliders can be used to set the minimum and maximum values you can get them free from hope this helps

4383,0,USER_MENTION serialport is in current production use by our customers
4384,1,wow thats a very interesting question im not exactly a pro at so i wonder why do you swap stacks at all
4385,-1,so i have also ran into this problem i have found a terrible be warned open unity and load your solution in monodevelop older version you can set the target framework more easily navigate to your project directory and open assemblycsharpvs in notepad change the line targetframeworkversion v3.5 to targetframeworkversion v4.0 you will have to do these steps every time you load but it does work
4386,-1,this is one thing that i really hate within development is forms below is my code and what i am trying to do is align the inputs with the labels is there a rule that you use to help remember when coding forms css html
4387,1,thanks to the two of you that answered what i ended up doing in case anyone else is interested was processing the openid login like normal but not saving the new user to the database instead i stored their information in a session var and asked them for the remaining information before adding them to the db and logging them in hope this helps
4388,-1,i have a big problem ive created site using jquery but it runs very slowly on mobile phones its terrible and i dont know whats wrong someone can help me links doesnt works yet because i want use cms on this layout but before i want to little optimise these scripts heres test site and here are the scripts
4389,-1,matt can you revue the accepted answer you have to scroll a long way to get to a javascript URL and i fear some users just take the accepted answer as gospel and use antiquated libraries as a result
4390,0,how can i get my attempt was
4391,1,if you are really worried about performance firstordefault is your second query is only going to execute if the first is null you could try using first lends itself to try catch which might be better for your situation you dont really need to worry about performance optimization until it becomes an issue though
4392,0,if string object allocations worry you then you should precompile the regular expression

4397,1,hope it works if you can upvote my answer id really appreciate it EMO_POS
4398,1,excellent did you know that you can answer your own question and accept it as answer this is considered a good practice because it helps people looking for answers see that there is an answer and it helps them find the answer if the answer is only in comments the question will appear unanswered
4399,-1,im afraid i dont know of any other option than work
4400,0,did you end up using an md5 as your primary key how did it go

4410,0,back in the private beta this question dates back to about a week after the private beta began the discussion aspect of the site was not terribly wellformed i didnt really want to state an opinion merely state an alternative approach i think the pros and cons have been adequately addressed in the other answers posts
4411,1,thanks for this i didnt know about fluid great little piece of software
4412,0,it winds me up when page n physical page
4413,1,USER_MENTION thanks for your answer EMO_POS that was surprising but excellent

4417,0,return some json with the state then some jquery should do it
4418,0,with the interoperability approach wsdlfirst are you still hand coding the wsdl if so are you still running into the same pain points youve described or have you have you found a better solution
4419,0,er can you explain how and why works
4420,-1,i now have this extremely ugly solution anybody a better idea
4421,0,wont the guilty party simply increase the minimum amount that theyll try i know theyre trying to fly under the radar of the banks and on bank statements but these days is a more common amount to see on your statement than do you have specific experience with this
4422,-1,i really fail to see the use case if you will type whats so hard and different about typing instead because even if you were to use this in a function youd get the local name of the variable in any case heres the in case theres something you need in there
4423,-1,i kept a bitmap inside a movieclip bitmap has been set to be smoothing but when i changed the scale of this movieclip it still got pixelated do we have the way to avoid it is really painful

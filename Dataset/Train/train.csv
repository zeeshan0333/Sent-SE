4053,1,+1 big fan of your blog Jason.
4054,1,[~lhofhansl]; thank you so much.
4055,0,So those need to be enabled on as as-needed basis. Kconfig knows about SSE and its ilk. Noted; will take care of it.

4057,-1,@DevSolar I would like to use boost more; but its synergy with C++11 is terrible; and there are some rather... _curious_ design decisions (Iostreams requires Devices to be copyable; but makes streams noncopyable... Oh; and also nonmovable - at least in th
4058,1,You should give a try. I haven't tested it but they mention that is works with Silverlight OOB apps and even give you a tutorial . It's commercial software; but a 30 day trial is available.
4059,0,bq. guess we need to supply a tool to rename sstables files if anyone is on longer names? We probably don't need to do anything. I don't think anyone is really using names long enough for them to it the file system limit; the goal of limiting the names is just so to prevent this from happening but there will be no other assumption that the names are short from the code. I also don't think anything will prevent rolling upgrades; do you had something in mind? Note: I have a long flight ahead of me so I plan to update my last patch with both those changes; as I still like the moving of all the directories handling in a dedicated class; even if we don't support both layout.
4060,0,As TraumaPony said. Simply load the main game assembly in to Visual Studio and try to compile it. It won't if you try to make a reference to an assembly outside the those that ship with the 360.

4062,0,She should also use parameterized queries and not have to worry about quotes at all!
4063,0,I need to get the current user too; but can't find that function... can you share the solution?
4064,0,If you insist using CODE_FRAGMENT; you can try the below 2 ways.
4065,0,It is not too late to do one. But because this runs also on the client and I am not sure how compatible those are with the Java ones I decided to write it this way. But you can look at the one I wrote for the source level in Utility.versionPattern if you feel nostalgic. You made me learn GWT regexps and do it!!! and it is here for all to see with all the regexp beautiful simplicity.
4066,1,Can anyone please review the attached patch ? Thanks
4067,-1,Your code sample strikes me as a very strange design and an abuse of what properties are intended for. Why not just an instance method : Your property also returns if the key does not exist; but claims to return an ; nor a .
4068,0,It would be good to try to use the (*types.Package).Name() instead of assuming that it's the same as the last segment of the import path; the latter is only a convention; and it is not followed by users of the http://pkg.in service.
4069,-1,I doubt that Squid is so bad at it.
4070,0,I've saw this after completed the issue.
4071,-1,I disagree. I don't think that would shorten the code by much.
4072,1,Hey I just had to solve this on a project I am working on; here is my answer Then in my configuration (I am using Fluent NHibernate to configure my unit tests in code) AWESOMENESSSSSSSS!
4073,0,Please be sure to review the following: # Collector class and documentation.
4074,0,This patch should do the trick.
4075,0,"Shouldn't ""reviewers"" be possessive; i.e. ""reviewer's""? Also; this sentence talks about singular reviewers; yet the next sentence uses plural (""they"")."
4076,0,I could put the finalizeForCommandLine after processExceptionAtExit. Then it doesn't change anything for LIB_MPI and that wouldn't work anyhow as you point out.
4077,1,Yes; updated the rb just now. Sorry; no perf numbers yet. Let me run some experiments for that. Thanks.
4078,-1,Unfortunately; I don't think so; since it probably contains the version of the metamodel which varies over time...
4079,1,+1. The patch looks good.
4080,1,Hey; thanks for that; I gave it some testing and thought about it over the weekend and it looks perfect; thanks! - Aidan

4087,0,Hello Paulex; The fix is fine.
4088,0,Give her full access; if she wants it. She's supposed to manage the project you are developing; and to do that efficiently; she might need to be able to look at any part of the project. Of course; there's always danger that she might do something stupid or malicious. If you have as part of your process auditing of any changes; you'll be able to find out if she messes anything.
4089,0,Assume closed as resolved and released
4090,1,No worries! Keep at it...it's overwhelming at first; but it gets easier
4091,0,[~smarthi] When I apply this patch; the source code cannot be compiled.

4108,0,The thing about backwards-compatibility hacks is you tend to get stuck with them.

4112,-1,guys... this is so stupid...
4113,0,Are all URL's encrypted when using SSL(https) encryption? I would like to know because I want all URL data to be hidden when using SSL(https). If SSL gives you total URL encryption then I don't have to worry about hiding confidential information form URLs.
4114,-1,I kept a bitmap inside a movieClip; bitmap has been set to be smoothing. but when I changed the scale of this movieclip; it still got pixelated. Do we have the way to avoid. it is really painful.

4116,-1,That sucks; why isn't the escape mechanism working?
4117,-1,Sorry; grabbed the wrong ticket.
4118,0,It is not obvious to me what this code snippet is doing; can you add a comment?
4119,-1,As you can see; the translucent text is clearly standard AA and rather than a clean translucent rendering; it has that awful '90s ``spidery ''appearance.
4120,1,It works pretty well and provides status information for impatient users. Note that nrms is a shared variable among the threads and that the line is overprint with the carriage return character in a fifo manner.
4121,0,This file demonstrates the problem described in this bug.
4122,0,Maybe it helps someone else: you can use www.browserstack.com to access VMs with different browser versions directly from the dev machine. (i have no affiliation with the company)
4123,-1,I'm very sorry.
4124,0,What are you trying to sort? Is there any reason not to use: I'm sure this uses QuickSort and you don't have to worry about making any coding errors. You can implement IComparable to change what you want to sort on. If all your data doesn't fit in memory... well the you're off to the races with Merge sort or something along those lines.
4125,0,You can also detect malicious bots; which wouldn't respect robots.txt using .
4126,1,I think its a good idea to go ahead and put a patch together so we can discuss it directly.

4129,-1,whenever i drag-n-drop a stored procedure onto my Context canvas; the parameters/arguments for the stored procedure are all nullable. Why is this? Is it because of how i've declared my parameters inside the stored procudure itself? Besides manually creating my stored procedure methods in the Context partial class (or drag-n-drop onto canvas; cut from autogen'd code; move to partial class; then remove nullables types) .. is there any way to fix this? It's really frustrating :(
4130,-1,Yup; wcf is a world of config pain; stick to asmx

4133,0,When the CODE_FRAGMENT command fails; it's almost always because of one of two things.
4134,0,It's also easier then to tell a wildcard-based config from a normal one.
4135,-1,I've been reading about MVC design for a while now and it seems officially the View calls objects and methods in the Model; builds and outputs a view. I think this is mainly wrong. The Controller should act and retrieve/update objects inside the Model; select an appropriate View and pass the information to it so it may display. Only crude and rudiementary PHP variables/simple if statements should appear inside the View. If the View gets the information it needs to display from the Model; surely there will be a lot of PHP inside the View -- completely violating the point of seperating presentation logic.
4136,0,Hi Tobias; Can you please fix the spaces here? i.e. for ($i = 0; $i < count($record->userids); $i++) { Thanks; Ghada

4138,1,Excellent; this works perfectly! Thank you :)
4139,0,I want to call a method after each 2 minutes; how can I apply such logic?
4140,0,We can use a BlockingQueue to make the patch simpler
4141,0,its not lining up side by side.
4142,0,This issue is about changing the way we name regions.
4143,0,Your explanation sounds reasonable and  the patch looks safe to me.
4144,0,Is it possible (or desirable?!) to set up to behave more like ? For example; instead of writing why can't I just write Similarly; instead of why not just

4146,-1,Terrible approach; XML stores data; not formats!
4147,-1,There is; of course; an API for the DRL compiler's parser; but it isn't stable and as complex as DRL rule syntax; which is considerable.
4148,-1,Damn time has flown...
4149,1,Looks like the 0.95 issues are timeout related...should be good to go.
4150,0,I got the idea for adding such a message from your change (only you had it even more verbose adding a message per approval that was copied). I can try to incorporate this into the patch set created message; but not sure if this is easily possible.
4151,0,Depending on what you need to accomplish; there might be better / other ways to achieve that.
4152,0,It's hard to say. I lost 5 nodes in about an hour; but I don't know how many I lost last time
4153,0,No; this is not the right fix. HDFS can *not* depend on MapReduce. Please remove the dependence completely.
4154,0,[BUGFIX] sql_fetch_assoc() and sql_fetch_row() should default to FALSE Initialize default output to FALSE for sql_fetch_assoc() and sql_fetch_row().

4157,0,And I see lot of demo and sample code about broadcasting with CODE_FRAGMENT.
4158,0,I too am using ideas from Rob's pattern and for now am updating like Pure.Krome. But i think concurrency is too vital to ignore and should be a habit of any enterprise application developer. I'm ignoring it for now; but it will go in my later iterations. I would really love to see how your approach turns out David.
4159,0,Note that the Derby builtin users are not created through a SQL identifier in the SQL language; e.g.
4160,1,wow; awesome! never knew this. Thanks again!
4161,0,I will investigate this issue and update the patch.
4162,1,Applied to trunk. Thanks Andrey
4163,0,Created an attachment (id=1333) xml/xsl testcase for normalize-space-bug
4164,0,yes; that's the point: if it's a *designer* plugin; it needs to depend on designer; as in the other example. but this is a ui loader/widget plugin only.

4167,1,Thanks for moving so quickly on this guys.
4168,1,committed to branch-4.0 and trunk. Thanks Rohini.
4169,0,Let's clean up all these issues in the incremental cache report JIRA (HDFS-5092); if this sounds good; I'll edit the JIRA description with these todo items.
4170,1,+1  Looks good to me!
4171,0,<danielsh> yes we're aware of the recurrence

4180,-1,Wrong CODE_FRAGMENT CODE_FRAGMENT attribute.
4181,-1,Done; sorry for all the mess on a simple patch.
4182,1,So my line extends from one side of my graph to the other; but it doesnt really animate through each data point; I assume I have to add a loop somewhere. Heres the relevant code. Any assistance would be hugely appreciated!!!
4183,0,If we're so bent on backcompat; I suggest deprecating one of these methods now and removing it in next major release.

4189,-1,Im working with VB 2010 In the form designer; trying to position some controls within a tab control. Sometimes when I drag a control to position it; it gets placed on a different tab than the one I currently have selected and am working with. This is extremely annoying and seems to happen randomly. Does anyone else ever have this issue?
4190,1,Hi Ramin; The patch looks good except I think it would be good to give import/export its own  SQLState starting with XIE instead of reusing the existing store FILE_EXISTS message.  Also it would be good to have test cases for writing the lob files. Kathey
4191,1,You're right. The issue is that the onSampleSelected() callback uses the Combo index to fetch the sample from mSamplePath; so the way you have it they don't match (if you try; selecting a sample will load a different one). The trivial solution is to sort mSamplePaths alphabetically like it should have been done in the first place anyway (my fault for forgetting that).
4192,0,Please look at this patch (d962_javadoc.2.diff.txt) I ran javadoc and  did clobber and ant all ok.
4193,-1,"i thinks that's the wrong one; the one that should be FROM is the ""pl"" library"

4195,1,The good news: CODE_FRAGMENT is true.
4196,-1,Well asp.net is problematic by itself in many ways. I can only imagine how the page is coded; but mostly asp.net submits are done in a very painful way through _doPostback where it sets additional hidden fields. You might want to try reading this and reviewing the generated html of the page

4200,-1,Unfortunately the SMBIOS UUID is not unique on all systems. It should be but it isn't. This is not because of a failure in the specification of the SMBIOS UUID; but is due to the fact that many manufacturers don't follow the spec when creating this UUID. For more information about how this goes wrong in practice see this Intel blog and the following instructive tale has some really awful examples from the real world: . By the way there is another more informative topic on stackoverflow about creating machine unique id's at
4201,1,Committed to trunk. Thanks Edward.
4202,-1,This algorithm is terribly inefficient for small sample chosen from a large set. Picking 5 integers from a million takes one million calls to rand() instead of 5.

4206,0,> The bug that I reported was actually on the change screen; I had not observed the same issue on the project page. Yep; the original fix was to fix the project page. It'd be great if we could fix both in one go.
4207,0,I'd delete the blank line. Ditto for the blank lines in peekUintStructField and peekIntStructField.

4211,0,It does NOT take precedence; but is executed as last step.
4212,0,Why would I want to use XML; when i can use the QBC API; or HQL (HQL can be embedded in the XML; remember); to express this stuff much more naturally?
4213,0,> Another thing: is the try ... catch good or bad?
4214,0,No I just need to perform an action whenever a button in that column is clicked.
4215,0,The accepted answer worked for me at the time.
4216,-1,Hmm; I still don't like these ternery operators used as statements; I would prefer using an if statement
4217,0,sure; but what I meant is that the element type can be elided if it's a composite literal (any composite literal) same below

Specifically the pound sign (£); but more would be great :) I don't have access to Flash right now and I've tried the automatic tools but with little success. I've looked everywhere; does anyone have any pointers? Many thanks!
4221,1,Excellent answer!! my vote is +
4222,1,Excellent! You should document that as an answer and accept it so many more people can solve this with a google search on 'single line of text' :)
4223,0,Also each String object contains reference to char array.
4224,0,James; I think it is time to do some of the tasks that you have outlined and I'm willing to do the work.
4225,0,It is not needed in trunk. Trunk will be taken care of in HADOOP-7853.
4226,1,In fact; if you happen to know why ObserverHammerQuorumTest is failing with this latest patch; I'd love to hear.
4227,1,Great - thanks for the heads up Ben!
4228,0,Seems like it doesn't need to be static; it only used in Schema_82 and is not static. I guess the answer is to be consistent with newStatement() below?
4229,0,Warning is -.
4230,0,We also need to check the return value from wal_commit as well.
4231,0,to get this index; use getElementIdx ( col; row ).
4232,1,Excellent! I got it working with your help.
4233,0,"There should be a more reliable way to check if an extension contains a ""cacheConfiguration"" definition. But I must admit I don't have a good idea yet..."
4234,-1,Aaron; sorry about this.
4235,1,+1 excellent question. Personally I'm starting to think that externals should never have been allowed to track the HEAD of other repositories. Always specifying the exact revision of the external is much safer.
4236,1,cool; no worries.
4237,0,So; using... It outputs CODE_FRAGMENT for me.
4238,0,Remember to have a CODE_FRAGMENT clause.
4239,1,Patch applied. Thanks a lot; especially for the test case. http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs?rev=240459&view=rev http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs?rev=240461&view=rev The result for 180 and -180 is definitely wrong. There's a bug that needs to be fixed eventually. But since this is low-priority for me; I'm going to leave it for now. I've added a comment to the new test case block-container4a that explains what is wrong. So I think I'll close this issue. It's primarily for the patch; after all; and the bug won't be missed now that there is a check in our test suite. If anyone disagrees; just reopen the issue or create a new one.
4240,0,Use spaces; rather than tabs; here; for consistency.
4241,1,WOW people THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR ANSWERS!!!! (bow)
4242,1,No worries; Greg!
4243,0,Zip is correct. It's a folder structure with quite a few xml documents inside. A plain text option might not be desirable (multiple files to manage...)
4244,0,I have the same problem; I think it caused by CODE_FRAGMENT's proxy.
4245,0,global local is the type? and enables needs to be True\False or 0\1 or yes\no ? you can write: <type = global\local> <enabled = True\False> enable or disable HE HA type of maintenance. or something like that..
4246,-1,why do we json_encode() $scopeData here? We do not do this in the base class. Furthermore it is already serialized. The only difference in this method compared to the one in the base class is now the Tree.thisScript stuff. The question therefore is: Is this a bug in the baseclass that Tree.thisScript is not set; or is it superfluous here? If neither applies; then still the question remains; if there's a nicer way of adding this code snippet without overriding (and copyiing) the complete method from the base class?
4247,1,excellent; thanks!
4248,0,Attached image showing blip padding in the Google Wave client.
4249,1,Thanks; Aaron!
4250,-1,Maybe name this installToDispatcher() or something like that? I had a hard time understanding all the different classes.
4251,-1,Okay; I understand what you're trying to do here. My concern is that we change the state from BACKFILL to IN_MEMORY even if there are backfill items in the queue or unAcked items in the ACK queue that we will implement soon. This will cause some confusions in debugging; showing stats in UI; etc. Let's add this to the to-do list and address it as a separate commit.
4252,-1,Sorry for the trouble Vikram!
4253,0,The patch looks pretty good to me. One question for you; though: does loosening this check for the QJM case not unnecessarily weaken the check in the non-QJM case?
4254,-1,Sorry [~kumarr]; let's just do this in 0.96.

4261,-1,Netbeans is showing all files and folders under /var/www/application/app/webroot/ as ignored; but that is not what is in the .gitignore file. Any ideas? This is incredibly annoying. Git version 1.7.9.5 Netbeans version 7.2.1 (Build 201210100934) Here is the ignore file:
4262,-1,No sorry.
4263,0,I'll have to bisect the revision since when it is broken and this could take some time.

4269,0,Yes; i am using maven.
4270,1,Thank you Thejas for the patch and Ivan for the review.
4271,1,Thomas Becker (author of the second link above) has a longer article which is excellent: http://www.artima.com/cppsource/type_erasure.html
4272,0,I've updated the patch to do this; but it still needs tests for this part.
4273,0,"first question here. I'm developing a program in C# (.NET 3.5) that displays files in a listview. I'd like to have the ""large icon"" view display the icon that Windows Explorer uses for that filetype; otherwise I'll have to use some existing code like this: The above code returns an integer that is used to select an icon from an imagelist that I populated with some common icons. It works fine but I'd need to add every extension under the sun! Is there a better way? Thanks!"

4276,-1,@Frederick Marcoux: it is really terrible advice
4277,0,that's what I thought; that's why I'm surprised
4278,0,Looks like this was fixed in HDFS-3966 (For branch-1; TestFileCreation should use JUnit4 to make assumeTrue work).
4279,-1,i’ll try this. string needs to be iterable. and while we are at it: how come java is so damn awful? no sane person would specify `remove` in an interface; just to add `throws UnsupportedOperationException - if the remove operation is not supported by this Iterator`.
4280,0,Maybe some info about the purpose (selecting node position?)
4281,0,You do not need to do anything special.
4282,0,I think if you use either LogDoc/ByteSizeMergePolicy; forceMerge also does what it says.
4283,0,Suppose to have an FILE_NAME; say CODE_FRAGMENT; and two non-abstract subclasses; say CODE_FRAGMENT and CODE_FRAGMENT.
4284,-1,No!! More sleeps!! I think we're up to 22 seconds now!
4285,1,Sorry Jacques; I have not seen that it was a grouped bugs. In this case I have used to set in the grouped bugs the sum of the components used by detailed issues. I didn't like unknow components. Otherwise we can add a new fictitious component - GROUPED ISSUES - and assign this component to this type of issue. Thanks Marco
4286,0,Also please list what manual steps were performed to verify this patch.
4287,1,Very good example of steady pooling readHere.

4294,0,Do not rely on compoundFilterToJsondbQuery to append the filter part to the query. Instead; let it create the filter part to another string and append it to the query.

4317,1,I am using some PHP script to add some data from a complex form to MySQL db and then showing it all in some HTML table. Everything works just fine; but I would like to 'upgrade' my script with jQuery and (I suppose) AJAX. What I would like to do is when user submits data; the row (or ) shows up in the HTML table without refreshing a page. Form and table are on same page; of course... Some guidelines would be really helpful because I'm not sure should I even use AJAX or something else for my needs. Links for some tutorials will be also great :) Thanks a lot for any help!

4343,-1,hI; I'm trying to get this code from Larry Nyhoff's book to compile in Bloodshed. It's actually been taken word for word from the author's website; though I declared it on .cpp instead of .h (the .h file ain't working with the tester application). The search(const DataType & item) function is what's giving me grief. The compiler error says: What I'm I missing here?
4344,-1,I am writing a WsCF service to retrieve data for multiple clients. I have a service layer that references business manager objects. In essence on the service call; I want to retrieve the provider type (a custom enum in my code) and the connection string from the web.config. For some reason; the code is unable to find the settings in my project web.config. I am gathering the IIS Express AND the VS development web server are referencing the machine.config. How do I override this. It is extremely frustrating. As you can see from the snippet the setting AND the connection string name exist; but the code never picks it up. My code: Private Sub GetDBInformation() The web.config:
4345,0,"bq. {{ catch (InterruptedException ignore) { Thread.currentThread().interrupt(); } }} Resetting the interrupt status of the thread is a good idea when we can't just re-throw the InterruptedException; but IMHO we should in that case *also* throw a TikaException to indicate that the requested operation couldn't be completed normally: {code} ...} catch (InterruptedException e) {    Thread.currentThread().interrupt();    throw new TikaException(""Interrupted""; e);}...{code}When the {{Process.waitFor()}} call is interrupted we can't just blindly assume that the process completed normally.

4362,0,dev_find_slot() explicitly returns a 0 (yeah; it's the same as a NULL).  Maybe that should be changed to return a NULL; but at this point; I think checking for 0 is reasonable. yes; if it's 0; we still reach the code.  I've changed it to not dereference it before checking it though.
4363,-1,I'm writing an Eclipse plugin for the JDT. I need a functionality that tracks certain strings or regular expressions and possibly creates markers. I know that Eclipse already does that for //TODO comments; for example (creating task markers for them) but I'm not sure if I can use the same mechanism. I can write my own but worried it would be too inefficient and not sensitive enough to code chnanges.
4364,-1,that´s really sad :(

4370,-1,I have just started using Vim in a terminal (PuTTY or MinTTY); after always using gVim. However; when using syntax highlighting; rather than the actual text colour changing appropriately; its background is changed to whatever colour -- and it looks horrible! I've set my terminal to use 256 colours and downloaded a 256 colour colour scheme. I checked that the and settings are as I expect; but I still get this problem... Is this a Vim or a terminal configuration issue?

4383,0,DHT_MSG_INODE_LK_ERROR sounds similar. Can that be used instead? If you add a new msgid; GLFS_DHT_NUM_MESSAGES needs to be updated.

My idea was to make a local mirror of the complete Jenkins public update-site through a Windows workstation that has internet access.

4420,0,I guess the obvious thing to do is to go in and reconfigure the pagination so it doesn't (paginate); but if we had the ability to add items to existing POs then you could still use the pagination mechanism and build up the PO page-by-page (quite handy if your working through  your POs during less busy times of the day).

4425,0,Using ArrayList is bad for several reasons: Performance: Due to changes in the hidden class it runs slower. It also does range checks which we definitely do not want. I am working to improve this; but at this point they do not perform in the same class. Assuming Array == JsArray: A lot of GWT code assumes this and that is a bad thing because there are a couple of things that we can not do to optimize array because of that (e.g. putting fields on an array makes FF opt out of some optimizations). I am thinking that we might want to model arrays as an object with a field for the array and other fields for GWT stuff (type info) and let the compiler inline all access to the array at the right places. This might make ArrayList as fast as JsArray.

4460,0,I know its possible to convert an image to CS_GRAY using however; this is a chokepoint of my entire program. I need to do this often; on 800x600 pixel images and takes about 200-300ms for this operation to complete; on average. I know I can do this alot faster by using one for loop to loop through the image data and set it right away. The code above on the other hand constructs a brand new 800x600 BufferedImage that is gray scale. I would rather just transform the image I pass in. Does any one know how to do this with a for loop and given that the image is RGB color space?

4471,0,I can do that. Easier for me. Up to you (the reviewers). Should I go ahead and change it?
4472,0,He might say he didn't work on the Mac port of Excel :p
4473,0,Yes; that's it. Since it fixes the problem; I'll commit the fix.
4474,0,Added as a subtask [HBASE-6157] to this parent jira.
4475,1,I second FlashDevelop. You don't get the visual design stuff for the MXML; but for the code (both MXML and AS) it's excellent.

4483,0,quick patch.
4484,0,This method now only sends email; I would change the name to reflect this fact.
4485,0,Content-wise the only part that stuck out to me was the inclusion of the many exceptions that users will never see.
4486,1,Pretty self explanatory question. I just don't know how to do it. I've been using Eclipse for about a month so I still have a lot to learn. I'm using the newest version of eclipse Juno and need to push the app (or email it) to my MyTouch. How would I do it from eclipse; as that is the way I would prefer? If I should just email it; would I email the whole project folder or just a particular piece of code? I thank you for all your help in advance. This site has been so incredibly helpful!
4487,1,I've used the ExprTk library in the past; it's easy to use and fast in evaluation. http://www.partow.net/programming/exprtk/index.html

4495,0,SYSSEQUENCESRowFactory o I think that you should flip the order of the keys in the second index.
4496,0,I think it should be optimizerCtx.getLastStepFor(NAME)+1; since the methods which are last modified by DeadCodeElimination are deadcode-free. Another concern is that when it is called by MethodInliner; actually we want to traverse the methods that modified by MethodInliner; not all the modified methods since last DeadCodeElimination. The result would be the same; but it may do unnecessary work in MethodInliner.
4497,0,This should read: This survey tests the local metadata performance using the echo_client to drive the MDD layer to perform operations.  It is run with multiple threads (to simulate MDT service threads) locally on the MDS node; and does not need Lustre clients in order to run.
4498,0,afaict things are working properly; at least on the ZK side of things.
4499,0,This patch solved this issue in a test case.
4500,0,Handling of services which aren't consumed and services which are consumed by multiple bundles is pretty weak.
4501,0,The obvious way to plot a path with virtual earth (VEMap.GetDirections) is limited to 25 points. When trying to plot a vehicle's journey this is extremely limiting. How can I plot a by-road journey of more than 25 points on a virtual earth map?

4509,0,Shouldn't the caller be informed? If not; the whole crc check is for debugging only.
4510,0,Is this possible? I have looked online and cannot seem to find an answer.
4511,1,You should definitely check out Jon Rista's three-part series on .NET 2.0 configuration up on CodeProject. Highly recommended; well written and extremely helpful! He shows how to create and use custom configuration sections; and goes on to explain how to use your own custom.config instead of or in addition to standard .NET config files. Marc

4522,-1,Ew; the `com` prefix is horrible!
4523,0,Jeremy; are you still planning to take a stab at this?
4524,1,Fixed the minor nits. Thanks; Sid!

4528,0,-1 tests included.
4529,0,The issue comes into play if you color a div; and set its opacity to make it transparent. If you then want to put text on this div; the text is transparent; and that isn't always desirable.
4530,1,Great; thanks for fixing the OSGi import. I'll create a new issue for the failing trunk build; with more info...https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SLING-2770

4533,0,What exactly is your configuration ?
4534,1,Committed to trunk and 4x. Thanks Simon!
4535,1,Sorry for that ! It's sometimes hard for us to describe a usecase that is so clear for us; but indeed not always for somebody else. Thanks for the time; and we'll try harder to explain in the future. About the jira issue; we'll try with full url's instead. This worked in 1.5.8 and 6.0.0; so we thought it was a bug. But now we know that it's just not supported anymore.
4536,0,Was the fix for one issue more responsible for the performance loss than the other?
4537,1,Hi; Ted; Matteo Thanks for the review. The commands.rb has some existing logic that tries to 'rescue' some exceptions. It will get more and more difficult to keep it generic artificially as we evolve and add more ... The approach to expand (instead of shrink) this logic is not a bad or ugly one ... But your suggested solution is fine.
4538,-1,Won't that be horribly distracting?
4539,0,Unrelated; should ApplcaitionTokenIdentifer be renamed to something like AMTokenIdentifier ?
4540,0,Fixed long ago.

4547,-1,Still that does not guarantee that the first thread will run and only then the second one will check if the size > 0.
4548,0,Does it make any difference if you go
4549,-1,I don't get it. How are those unused locks got rid of?
4550,1,Works excellent; many thanks!
4551,0,Here's a question about what's the difference between them: Gson Type Adapter vs. Custom Deseralizer.
4552,1,Here's a knocked up utility to prove the point.
4553,0,Default is true.
4554,-1,I wouldn't bother with bufio.NewReader; just read 100 bytes or something rather than bothering with ReadString.
4555,-1,Vineet; what you are trying to do is a terrible idea! If you ever find yourself having to engineer something as fundamental as that; take a step back and work out what else does it! I don't really believe in the whole spoon fed SO thing; but what mtwebster says is on the right track!
4556,0,You can probably instruct your web server to compress the data for you at the HTTP level; and then you won't have to worry about it on either end. For Apache; have a look at .
4557,0,This is the reverse side of ARIES 399; which dealt with a deadlock in ServiceRecipe.

4565,0,patch that replaces the numeric constant value with the symbolic name of the enumerated constant
4566,-1,I really hate regex in principle. can it be done in a plane script or something?
4567,1,I have an old friend who is a mathematician. He has his own math to compress his formulas; which are incredibly beautiful. He works in a program called Mathematica; which transforms the formulas for 3D-shapes. I wonder if it is possible to obtain these figures using Canvas and JavaScript? See attached formula and figure. I know little of this myself. But I would be delighted if some one could show me an example.
4568,1,thanks again Uwe
4569,1,+1 for the sarcasm!
4570,1,Excellent; thanks! This was very useful to me.
4571,1,@sheidaei great :) keep it up! you even get 2 point bonus for accepting.
4572,0,What is context and what is CODE_FRAGMENT?
4573,0,Additionally you may customize the parsing behavior by providing appropriate dependency properties.
4574,0,If we were using scans; prewarming client cache would be near costless (as opposed to what we'll currently have to do which is first a getClosestRowBefore and then a scan from the closestrowbefore forward).
4575,-1,I can't help think that making XML ad XMLList both unrelated; as in both extend Object directly; is a design flaw in the AS3 core library. Surely having XML extend XMLList would be a much cleaner system; where XML is considered an XMLList with only one member? This would also avoid the very annoying practice of an E4X query possibly returning either an XML or XMLList; which can result in a casting error. So is there any reason I'm not thinking of that XML and XMLList were designed to only have Object as a common type?
4576,1,Thank you!
4577,0,"""Sort by Name""; ""Sort by ID""; ""Sort by Time""? Strange to test that as it has no effect on the time selection; and no effect on the tree if there is only one trace and only one thread."

4579,-1,I hate to say it; but constant polling over HTTP is the poor mans solution.
4580,0,Closing all 1.6.0 issues
4581,0,Maven; I am on the fence about it. We actually do not need all the libs I included. Having them in a tarball sounds good; but making a maven repo for only this purpose seems to be a lot of work. {quote} Should we attempt to factor out the HBase commonality immediately; or commit the overlapping code and then do refactoring as a followup? I'm fine either way; I can give suggestions on how to create the reusable abstract bases and where to package+name them.{quote} If you can specify specific instances then sure. The code may be 99% the same; but that one nuance is going to make the abstractions confusing and useless. I await further review.
4582,1,"+100 for this :-) you made my day!! When writing the question I was not sure if it was related to ""Brook's mythicalman month"" and skipped it. Here I go ... and it's persisted for eternity on stackoverflow :-) I am really ""rofl"" that stackoverflow can answ"

I guess you meant to use Boolean.parseBoolean(this.jcd.getAttribute(""org.apache.jetspeed.engineScoped""; ""false"")) instead of Boolean.getBoolean(...).

4591,0,How do I code for a company icon to appear on the left-side next to the URL address in the browser's address bar?
4592,-1,Confused about this.
4593,1,That's a bit of a philosophical discussion. I thought about it earlier; but the reason for limiting the range is that we only use the single precision range in the SIMD parts of Gromacs - since all algorithms in particular need to work if the user has set the precision to single - we only use double to improve precision; not range. One _could_ of course add double precision range tests; but then the next obvious question is why we allow routines to provide incorrect results for NaN; +-infinity; negative zero; etc? And; of course; not to mention - why we allow more than 1 ulp error :-) For the error functions I actually experimented a bit with only providing accurate results in a smaller-than-double-precision-range; and this might still be a useful optimization strategy in the future. Thus; I like the idea of merely testing what we actually need; and if somebody comes up with a neat idea to improve that while only altering things we don't need; that should fundamentally be a good thing(TM)!

4622,0,The length of a Python Unicode string in a narrow-Unicode build is the number of UTF-16 *code units*; not actual Unicode code points. Truncating and other slicing options that go by arbitrary index can indeed split a surrogate pair in half; with the result of some missing/replaced characters. On a narrow build; `unichr(0x10345)` simply fails; `len(u'\U00010345')` is `2`. This is the price you pay for easy interaction with Win32 UTF-16LE APIs. Most other environments use UCS-4 which doesn't suffer from any such problem.

4632,0,It was OK in my mind to not fix ResourcesViewTest but at least help ControlFlowViewTest and ControlFlowViewFiltering. But I try getExpandedElementCount instead. We can't check the exact count because it can change; see https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/65024/ 
4633,1,I have a few months of experience with Ruby on Rails and really loved it from the beginning on. Now; for work; I was asked to code in Grails and although I first had some objections; I now think it's a very decent framework. One thing that really impressed me in Grails are Taglibs because they make frontend modularity so much easier. I would really like to do something with Rails. Is there anything like Taglibs for Rails? If not; what are the best practices for accomplishing this kind of view modularity (and; in essence; making my life easier)?
4634,0,Also; I won't give you a patch next time; but just the whole new TestTransSystem.

4669,0,Could you make sure that the following path exists on your machine: C:\Program Files\Apache\Tomcat 6.0\webapps\ode\WEB-INF/jpadb It sometimes happen that Tomcat; for some reason; fails to open the WAR which results in an incomplete deployment.
4670,0,"I think columnName is a property that indicates a column's name.  I'm going more for ""which column should we extract from the file"".  I thought about maybe columnToUse.  I'm not sure because this configuration is going on a wiki page.  I'll change it for clarity; we can think about it more when we do the mediawiki change."
4671,1,Found the culprit! At first I tried the solution suggested by @billinkc in the comment; it worked (I managed to create a folder) but the folder wasn't usable as I couldn't upload packages. I have db_owner permission on the MSDB database and so I can see and access the SSIS MSDB folder. What I really needed was the db_ssisadmin permission. Not to worry as db_owner permissions allow me to give myself the db_ssisadmin permission! After this was done; all the problems (the one in the original Q and more) disappeared.
4672,-1,My goal is to write a cookie when the user authenticates. We are using a crappy framework that hides its source code and event model so when I use their login control I can't set a session timeout on it! Anyhow; I am trying to write a cookie when the user is logged in; and then refresh the cookie expire time on subsequent page views (sliding expiration). So I figured I could initially create the cookie during Application_AuthenticateRequest in teh global.asax but that seems to be firing even when the user hasn't signed in yet. Is that suppose to be the case?

4691,1,"Some thoughts I had about this: Overall; I think it's a good idea.  Seems like it's not crazy to add and would have multiple benefits.  Logical striping across the L1 boundary is a simple solution to both proactively handle splits and reduce compaction times. Thoughts on this feature 1. Fixed configs : in the same way that we got a lot of stability by limiting the regions/server to a fixed number; we might want to similarly limit the number of stripes per region to 10 (or X) instead of ""every Y bytes"".  This will help us understand the benefit we get from striping and it's easy to double the striping and chart the difference. 2. NameNode pressure :  Obviously; a 10x striping factor will cause 10x scaling of the FS.  Can we offset this by increasing the HDFS block size; since addBlock dominates at scale?  Really; unlike Hadoop; you have all of the HFile or none of it.  Missing a portion of the HFile currently invalidates the whole file.  You really need 1 HDFS block == 1 HFile.  However; we could probably just toy with increasing it by the striping factor right now and seeing if that balances things. 3. Open Times : I think this will be an issue; specifically on server start.  Need to be careful here. 4. Major compaction : you can perform a major compaction (remove deletes) as long as you have [i;end) contiguous.  I don't think you'd need to involve L0 files in an MC at all.  Save the complexity.  Furthermore; part of the reason why we created the tiered compaction is to prevent small/new files from participating in MC because of cache thrashing; poor minor compactions; and a handful of other reasons. So; some thoughts on related pain points we seem to have that tie into this feature: 1. Reduce Cache thrashing : region moves kill us a lot of time because we have a cold cache.  There is a worry that more aggressive compactions mean more thrashing.  I think it will actual even this out better since right now a MC causes a lot of churn.  Just should be thinking about this if perf after the feature isn't what we desire. 2. Unnecessary IOPS : outside of this algorithm; we should just completely get rid of the requirement to compact after a split.  We have the block cache; so given a [start;end) in the file; we can easily tell our mid point for future splits.  There's little reason to aggressively churn in this way after splitting. 3. Poor locality : for grid topology setups; we should eventually make the striping algorithm a little more intelligent about picking our replicas.  If all stripes go to the same secondary & tertiary node; then splits have a very restricted set of servers to chose for datanode locality."
4692,0,Attached patch.  I plan to commit in a day or two.

I've only ever had to use a Safari CSS hack once as a temporary solution and later got rid of it. I agree that you shouldn't have to target just Safari; but no harm in knowing how to do it. FYI; this hack only targets Safari 3; and also targets Opera 9.

4710,0,I'm working with an incorrectly built spring application. Rather than use IOC; objects that require references are pulling their references from the context: Putting aside the non-IOC design; what are the other detrimental effects of this? For example; does this have any particular performance implications? Is there any way that this could result in the creation of additional contexts or object references? Anything else really unpleasant that this could cause?

4724,0,"Using nutch with solr has been a very demanding request; so it will be very useful when this makes into trunk. I have spend some time reviewing the patch; which I find quite elegant. Some improvements to the patch would be - make NutchDocument implement VersionedWritable instead of writable; and delegate version checking to superclass - refactor getDetails() methods in HitDetailer to Searcher (it is not likely that a class would implement Searcher but not HitDetailer) - use Searcher; delete HitDetailer and SearchBean - Rename XXXBean classes so that they do not include ""bean"". (I think it is confusing to have bean objects that have non-trivial functionality) - refactor LuceneSearchBean.VERSION to RPCSearchBean - remove unrelated changes from the patch.(the changes in NGramProfile; HTMLLanguageParser;LanguageIdentifier;... correct me if i'm wrong) As far as i can see; we do not need any metadata for Solr backend; and only need Store;Index and Vector options for lucene backend; so i think we can simplify NutchDocument#metadata. We may implement :  Or alternatively we may wish to keep add methods of NutchDocument compatible with o.a.l.document.Document; keeping the metadata up-to-date as we add new fields; using this info at LuceneWriter; but ignoring in SolrWriter. This will be slightly slower but the API will be much more intuitive. "
4725,-1,Have created a module in DotNetNuke 7. Have made changes on my local test version which has created several rows in the database. I then copied these rows into the live database but they dont appear in the live version of the module. Have tried clearing the cache through host settings and restarting the application and it still won't show new rows. Have even tried setting cache settings to non-specified and still won't load new rows. Is there a way I can completely reset and get it find the new rows. This is an extremely irritating feature.
4726,0,This should be safe because this string isn't really used in the GUI - it's used as one of the arguments in a later format string; so it's copied. In fact I could (and probably should) just use NULL instead of packet_scope().

4748,0,Well; keep in mind that (in theory) you have the original code to help; as well as the text of the log messages. The only thing that should be obfuscated would be the class and member names. In addition; many tools (Dotfuscator is one) create a map file to tell you what obfuscated construct name maps back to which original name - this can make it a pain to figure out exactly where the log messages come from; but nowhere near impossible.

4827,-1,i think there was a problem with d'tors as well. not too relevant; as we don't support unloading anyway.
4828,0,Given that my client code knows everything it needs to about the remoting object; what's the simplest way to connect to it? This is what I'm doing at the moment:
4829,0,Applied patch with thanks to Dan :)

4831,0,Patch now applies cleanly against latest version of trunk.
4832,1,I need to do a strange task. I want to move whole android system to external SD card on Android Virtual Device. I need to do this; because android emulator; emulates SD commands; only for external card image. And I want to get SD commands trace; during Android Virtual Device usage. To be more precise: I want to move at least /system and /data folders to external storage. In such way; that system could still work fine =) Thank You!

4836,-1,I'm trying to output the following from within a liquid template: Obviously; Liquid sees this as a variable named and tries to do substitution. I'm trying to find out how I can output the actual braces. So far; I've found one method that works; but it's incredibly ugly: Yeah; told you it was gross. Here are other things I've tried: Any advice here?

4842,1,I'm building a marketplace application that uses PayPal Express. I've got a form for sellers to input their PayPal API credentials; but I need a way to validate them by making some sort of call to PayPal. I'm using the PaypalExpressGateway in ActiveMerchant; and I don't see anything other than the standard purchase controls. Is there any sort of null-operation that can be used? Any help would be greatly appreciated!
4843,0,This patch takes care of the nocommits in the previous patch.
4844,0,Since we know meta splitting doesn't work; can we put in some code that allows META's one region to grow without bound regardless of its size?
4845,0,In some cases there is a trade that you need to do; thus you should take into account your project's requirements.
4846,1,I have an application that is being built using Qt. It will be running on machines that will have two (or more) network cards. I need the ability for my application to select which ethernet interfaces for a TCP connection. Before anyone suggests it I cannot guarenteed that routing tables will be setup correctly. I know how to do this using the windows socket classes but have been unable to find anything about it for Qt. Any help would be greatly appreciated!
4847,0,you have to use symlinks instead of an alias... sad there is no ui for that! you have to go into the Terminal and type: the first PATH is the base path of the original file and the second is for the base path for the symlink of the file/folder etc
4848,0,So; the original problem appears addressed (as I said; the 3 failing tests now pass); but I will investigate these behaviors; and run on another type of machine just to be safe.

4852,0,The first statement seems to pull back everything from the DB and then the second statement gets a subset. What if you just want a subset in the first place? I have 90;000 rows and just want page 4 of 10 rows.
4853,0,The 'all' link is a link that is js controlled - is 'follow' the right word to use here?

4858,0,Out of the box; in MS Reporting Services; the image element does not allow for the centering of the image itself; when the dimensions are unknown at design time. In other words; the image (if smaller than the dimensions allotted on the design surface) will be anchored to the top left corner; not in the center. My report will know the URL of the image at runtime; and I need to be able to center this image if it is smaller than the dimensions specified in my designer.
4859,0,The icon may be unnecessary; maybe just onhover on the text itself?
4860,0,Again; you must continue the original numbering and then update LAST_STR_HERE.
4861,0,I think they are trying to match with the access control section data; which uses local because it used to also have the inherited rules from parent projects; and the local rules were in their own collection so the UI could tell them apart.
4862,0,can we apply the jarjar solution only to commons-csv?
4863,0,Multiply by 100 and then convert to an int.
4864,0,I don't want to put too much magic in the classloader structure; because it becomes messy as hell in an instant.

4870,0,22.2 close(): Could we rename it to shutdown to map startup()?
4871,0,I can just about cope with the amount of manual intervention required; but in the not too distant future I can see the need for some of the rules you suggest.
4872,0,Here's a Perl solution Here's a Ruby solution Here's a Ruby one-liner solution: What the one-liner is doing is using a regular expression substitution of the first character of each word with the uppercase version of it.
4873,1,Awesome -- this approach will work! Thanks! BTW -- I've followed your blog for quite some time! Thanks!
4874,1,@knatten - Great Idea! Please update the table at the end :)
4875,0,Only way I could figure out how to do it without just moving the file and telling the user was to pass it off to the browser.
4876,-1,Sorry; you're right.
4877,0,What about abstracting this even further: instead of requiring a region_device to describe the location; we could just accept the name of an FMAP region and look up its offset and size.
4878,0,Let's fight with the right weapons when we need; I wouldn't use a katana to kill a fly (unless I am Bruce Willis and I'm in Pulp Fiction :P) best and thanks!
4879,-1,I have a screen with say 20 controls on it. I want to show all twenty; then hide only the ones that don't relate to what I'm working on. My problem is that between the loops the screen paints. It looks very ugly. I know I've seen this done but for the life of me I can't find that code; or even remember what app I'd seen that code in.. Does anyone know how to suspend the paint for a bit?
4880,0,You should be able to set an expectation on and then call directly.

4891,1,Is there anyway to control the styling of the scrollbars of a div tag? I am experiencing some contrast issues between IE7 and FireFox 3.5.2. Any help would be greatly appreciated!
4892,-1,Combining NH attributes and some FNH automapping stuff looks very scary. I do not understand it at all but IMO classic ClassMap is much more transparent. You must pay with more key strokes but your head hurts less:). and this code deletes connection and endpoint as well from database:
4893,0,A few notes.
4894,0,here we are changing the default to 0666 but in open it is 0777; we should have only one. I think 0777 was chosen based on what python os module does; but could be wrong...
4895,0,"Jason; I suggest you create a separate issue something like ""Integrate BytesRefHash in Realtime Branch"" and I will take care of it."

4911,1,Your implementation looks absolutely fine to me! A range-based away subscript is a type for performance reasons. It does not copy the indicated sub-array; instead it just points to the range defined by the you provide to the subscript.

4931,1,I just committed this.  Thanks; Sanjay!
4932,0,You should use a CODE_FRAGMENT for this task.
4933,0,I am using NHibernate mapping-by-code to map the classes. Sometimes; in order to debug my NHibernate configuration; I would require to check exactly what were the settings passed over to NHibernate; and it is quite difficult do debug the mapping-by-code. Is there any way where you could convert the generated HbmMapping; back into the Xml file; just as if typed by hand? This would help a lot in diagnosing if the problem is lying from my mappings!
4934,0,2) The ZKVersion used in the <topic;region> map is used to guard against the case different hub-server use the map at the same time (or interleaved).
4935,1,Thanks for providing this update. WIll try to take a look at this sometime this week.
4936,0,Alternatively; I don't know what is the compiler error on Debian; but it may very well be missing the include inside BoostMutex.cpp: {code} #include <boost/thread/mutex.hpp> {code} Thanks!

4943,0,Since an approach to put back two such HRegionInterface level measurements with a query/mutate distinction has been +1ed on this issue I'm going to put them back on trunk and port back the changes to 0.94.
4944,1,Thanks! Looks like a good clean-up to me. I admit I didn't check all the changed lines in detail; but the approach gets my +1 :)
4945,1,Excellent resource:
4946,-1,The dreadful integer arithmetic attacks again! When you calculate ((3+2+1)/100); since all the operands are integers; Ruby uses integer arithmetic rather than floating point arithmetic. If you do 7/100 it will also return 0; as it's rounded down to the nearest integer; which is 0.
4947,-1,All but one of the answers you got provide another frightening example of how people can get very basic C syntax wrong.
4948,-1,Google showed me: However; it removes the blinking carets from ALL of your applications [which includes eclipse]; so you probably won't want that ._. Unless.. you totally abhor blinking carets
4949,0,Is it the JVM that runs out of memory or the Windows process?
4950,-1,COM components are really a pain to manage; update; versioning; etc.
4951,0,Why not do dict_get_str and use the ptr to find the index. That will avoid more book keeping
4952,1,That's correct behavior.
4953,0,Thanks!
4954,0,Then it's up to you to add the relevant code to the method body.

4964,-1,I am Having a xml file with around 60 to 70 tags. while calling the callbacks method of SAX Parsers startElement;endElement;characters the excessive use of if else makes code extremely painful.Are there any other way through which i can make my code more readable?
4965,0,You should definitely HTML encode before assigning posted content to the HTML body of an email. Your code should already be rejecting content such as '<script>' as invalid; not just in the case of an email but in all cases. There are no other considerations you need to worry about.
4966,0,Where do we handle the COMPILER_RT_rmodules_$(4) ? Is that just included in the objs ?
4967,0,Instead of J#; I would rather prefer IKVM () to convert my JARs to .NET assemblies as well as access Java APIs in C#.

4973,0,shouldn't that be exp(-beta_i u_i) / sum_k exp(beta_k u_k)

4975,0,use functionDecl->getLocation() instead of functionDecl->getSourceRange().getBegin(); so the caret is nicely positioned under the start of the function name

5004,0,If you're really worried about that; make an NSTimer that fires in say 5 seconds; and send traffic when it fires. Invalidate the timer when your view disappears.
5005,0,There must be some side effect in my project that circumvented this problem until 6.8.0.
5006,0,This could be done with a static const char* [] data array; using the enum value as an index. It would generate much less code in the end.
5007,0,If you are not completely allergic to Perl; then comes with a tool named that can split a document; producing well-formed XML section. You can split on a level of the tree; by size or on an XPath expression.
5008,1,I see. I can probably help you with that. I would like to assert that if HAVE_USBDEBUG is available the chipset and/or mainboard does the setup in bootblock to get things at least halfway working. That or so early in romstage it is before console. I think that is a good goal to have.
5009,0,Any decent browser should protect against malicious code in images so I don't think you'll have to worry. If you're truly concerned you can use a combination of getimagesize() and see about using a ClamAV extension/program to scan files for malicious code. Nothing is perfect though.
5010,1,Thanks for taking a look; Jiannan

What is going on? In the Simulator it is all okay.

5027,0,I have a xml similar to this one: The thing is; Im able to get all the info tags; but I get the results from all dates. I dont know what the dates will be; since the are dynamic generated. What I know is that I may have a data tag with one or two date tags I wish I could show the first date´s info on a list box and the second date´s info on another listbox. How can I do that? Desirable Output: If there´s a second date then print it too: Thx!
5028,0,I will look at applying this later today.
5029,0,My assumption is that; when you make a request to read 1k from a disk file; that the OS reads substantially more than 1k from the disk and places it in the buffer cache.
5030,0,Now again in the next trip of finalization; it will throw NodeExistsException; here it is really required to do the #store.
5031,0,Yeah; I didn't mean to imply that setting a null value was the problem; which is why I changed my comment to denote the problem was actually in the federated connector.
5032,0,In general; one should thus rely on the buffer cache and read-ahead; and make input buffers only big enough so that system call overhead is insignificant.
5033,0,Your patch was applied at 553723.
5034,1,Awesome! This tool is cool.
5035,0,In the below code; a book time is a period of time in which appointments can be made.
5036,0,{quote} Yes; was an oversight.

5041,0,I have also tried to use.
5042,0,I have a Java application that's very String-heavy - it takes a feed of huge numbers of big; different String objects. Do I need to worry about the String Constant Pool for memory and performance? Is there any way to see how big the pool is at any point?
5043,0,How to print multiply flowdocumets in a batch? Following code should print different documents but print the same. This sample works pretty fine only if you print to the xps printer.
5044,0,Using the Windows API; how can I get a list of domains on my network?
5045,-1,It was a painful process for us. I can't remember hardly any of the specific things that made it so difficult; but I do remember it sucked.
5046,0,One of my earlier patches had the log.info 3.
5047,0,I don't know that there's an alternative that would be less invasive than reverse logical time.
5048,1,A great explanation! Thanks:)

5050,1,"limit the results as well as -> the ""wel"" needs to get a second ""l"" ;-)"
5051,1,This is not particularly unusual... or wrong.
5052,-1,I have an existing javascript/flash -interaction kludge that sucks terribly. Now I've decided it'd be better to write a flash app that does the specific thing without the need to interact with javascript. Therefore I'd need to produce flash apps in linux; and I don't have money to throw at adobe right now (perhaps never if their software keeps being terrible). Also not going to do software development on windows; have been there; conclusion: that's not going to work well ever. So; any solutions? Free or open source?
5053,0,A test suite that shows the issue
5054,1,Excellent! I hope you liked the `$.when.apply(...)` with its double nested .joins. That's the bit I had to test.
5055,-1,I don't think we should let people modify a branch that they don't have access to; even if it is for a commit that they are replacing that used to be in another branch. Locked down is locked down; right? I see how it might be annoying to have to redo a change if you used the wrong branch the first time; though... Perhaps there is some Git magic that can let you do that painlessly?
5056,0,thanks asankha
5057,0,The patch should work on all fair scheduler versions.
5058,0,Same question on side-effects as on the previous file
5059,0,Maybe you can use the to do this.
5060,0,No. I did find it useful to fail a test case from a fake server implementation when the client in the main goroutine does an invalid request but since this is not desired behavior; I abandoned the change.
5061,0,Will close this as a dup.
5062,0,comments on phabricator

5065,1,Thanks for finding and fixing. The patch applied at r474719
5066,0,$(dirname $0) would mean you don't break if someone runs this from another dir.
5067,0,@pek what is Main.class.getre.....?
5068,0,should be a local typedef in the single function that uses it
5069,0,Dug this up: WEB_ADDRESS.
5070,-1,Yep; my bad.
5071,1,Committed revision 741710. Thanks Patrick!
5072,1,This looks safe also
5073,-1,Just a word of advice - this will be painful to extend if you later want to add a proper user-login system; and/or a threaded reply structure.
5074,-1,My bad.
5075,0,worked for me too..
5076,1,Tnx for the quick fix. Works perfect!
5077,0,So in order to instantiate ChromeDriver; you need to.

5079,0,I meant for each newly added/deleted ones.
5080,-1,bq. this is solr's fault by having a getter that does some heavy duty xml shit.
5081,0,It signifies 10% of generated values will be __fixed_ values - their respective bin means!
5082,0,The behaviour still occurs in the last snapshot using both Mojarra 2.1 or MyFaces.
5083,0,patch committed in rev 942983; thanks!
5084,0,LGTM but it would be better to follow the message format of the above 'print'.
5085,0,I considered using ioutil.TempDir but had similar concerns as Minux. It is unclear to me whether any state in PPROF_TMPDIR is expected to persist between calls to pprof. Also; since there isn't a single test covering the pprof internal libraries; I opted for the smallest possible change. From cmd/pprof/README I get the impression that the code is frozen to a certain extent; so I didn't want to change too much either.
5086,0,Created an attachment (id=10304) test.xml
5087,0,We have equalsIgnoreCase; so having that ability for EqualsBuilder (and therefore HashCodeBuilder) seems apt.
5088,1,Fixed; thanks for the suggestion: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=498105
5089,0,[~ashutoshc] Yeah you are right.
5090,0,Latest commits now include filemgr and workflowmgr integration.
5091,-1,"I'm afraid you're either reading Steve Sounders' post wrong; or typing it wrong. Steve's findings are that his Squid proxy didn't cache the querystring URL - which is the exact opposite of ""require filename changes in order to break the cache""."
5092,-1,I'm apologize for saying this; but the code you've posted is simply awful and needs desperate refactoring. Create a class to represent 7 properties instead of 7 parallel arraylists; and use String.split to parse a comma-seperated list.
5093,0,In a week you can expect another ``fun ''.
5094,1,Thanks James; does the rest of the build work with this patch? Seems like this should work with the old RHEL5 toolchain but I didn't look closely.

5109,-1,Don't introduce new types unless you truly need them; they are supposed to be equivalence classes; and the more you define; the larger the policy will grow (GS4 policy has significant bloat due to unnecessary types that get _exactly_ the same allow rules as existing types).

5117,-1,I have to setup a rails project and rubygems.org is seemed to be down. That's really horrible. Can't believe it the whole ruby community have only one single not-so-reliable gems source. What should I do in such case?
5118,1,Thanks; I've committed your patch; leaving out the change to equals() and not removing mergeBooleanQueries() as that is a public method which someone might be using. Also; could you please check if the test case is correct now? I couldn't apply that part of your patch cleanly and something might have been broken.

5128,0,Violated again in r960471.
5129,0,I encounter the same NullPointerException in the 4.1.0 source code release; but currently I don't have a git 4.1 environment to verify it.
5130,0,As I said in previous comment; explicit lookups coming from above layers are never avoided. Its only during the cases where readdirp is followed by a fop; a lookup is triggered by gfapi/fuse. Self-heal is an example of lookup dependent operation. There might be other xlators which might do some house keeping activities in lookup which are necessary before a fop is performed. In this case; if a readdirp is followed directly by a fop; then those house keeping activities wont be performed. So to let those activities happen before performing the first fop on a newly linked inode (via readdirp) an explicit lookup is triggered by gfapi/fuse. Once lookup is done; then we need not repeat it for further fops. So the flag is unset after lookup.

5140,0,This newest patch applies cleanly and tests all pass.
5141,0,Thanks!
5142,0,if this was copied from another IT (?) and the GAV was not changed; it will conflict with the other IT when 'mvn install' installs it into the local repo. It's a good idea to make all GAVs used  in test projects specific to the IT that is being run to avoid unwanted crosstalk/side-effects between unrelated ITs; esp. when they are being run in parallel. (and I know some ITs we have are not good examples for this...) I.e. same comment applies to all pom.xmls used here for test projects.

I've been tasked with making sure this piece of software is functioning correctly; but given no further instructions. How would I go about testing this? .NET tools aren't what I've normally used; so I'm at a complete loss here!
5153,1,any chance to get a patch also for this? :)

5163,1,If you handle the RowDataBound event you can check the value of the data and modify the attributes of the cell or apply a different style in that event handler. That should give you what you are looking for. Let me know if you need it in VB rather than C#. Good Luck!
5164,1,Great question!! I'm hoping to use something like migrations with Django too.
5165,-1,I really hate that object...

5175,0,Where the extra parameter CODE_FRAGMENT is to enable the append mode.
5176,1,+1 for this question - I have the same issue.
5177,0,I think it is probably cleaner to put CAS change in the caller rather than del() here.  The caller knows it is a normal deletion or delWithMeta(). The del() here is a generic function and should not take care of CAS issues. Also; is it better to get a brand new CAS here? What is the point to increment the CAS for a normal deletion? CAS is a token; it is not meant to be incremented/decremented. We grab a new CAS for other operations; seems not quite consistent to me to increment it here.
5178,0,I usualy send all mine to /dev/null that way I don't ever have to worry about it. I have known some people who set it to /bin/logout so that when someone logged in they were logged back out.

5183,0,That's just the thing; I don't have a bug report. Somebody complained on Google+ that setting this attribute has the undesirable side effect of killing onClick attributes; when I asked Roman if he knew anything about this (we had discussed textIsSelectable before; in the context of adding them to the default templates) he mentioned he had also seen some weirdness around these; but didn't have details. I should dig deeper; but since I'm swamped with some other work I figured it was better to just disable this check until I know more. (It's actively suggesting users set an attribute that apparently isn't always the right thing.)
5184,-1,I am sorry for posting so many questions; but getting this to work has been incredibly painful; even tho Testflight makes it much easier I figure this has got to do with my Apple Push Notifications. I am using my distribution profile across all my settings. My app has been configured to both development and production. What could the causes of this error be? As a side note; i have been working on this for the entire day; and i get stuck at one thing after the other; esp involving static libraries and xcode4. Am I really bad at this; or does Apple really make it so hard?

5189,1,Yeah; major documentation work in the next few weeks; so we can all use our time more efficiently when new or wasn't-paying-attention-then developers come on board. Today; only worried about completing the rc while not creating repeat work later! :-)

5193,0,Do you have any JNI in your application code? Then maybe you need to worry about 32 vs. 64 bit native binaries. 32 or 64 is all the same to your Java code. The performance aspects already seem well covered by previous posters.

5208,0,Hi; I was going to join in on reporting this problem. I had recently downloaded a build from 10/17/2005 in order to fix a problem I was experiencing with jscookmenu. It was not until today that I ran a test in IE and found inputcalendar didn't work. I had the same JavaScript error: dateFormatSymbols. The calendar worked fine in Firefox. Today I downloaded MyFaces 1.1.1RC3 and can confirm that this problem no longer seems to exist for me. Cheers; Kevin
5209,0,I think I'd rather have a CL option so it can still raise an error if you think (say) just one node is down but a second goes offline briefly as you run the loader.  But --skip-dead-nodes would also be reasonable.
5210,0,Pixel Bender files don't run under iOS. See other limitations here:
5211,-1,yeah; if it's fatal; we might as well just revert the serial patch.  The whole purpose of the serial (or ehci-debug) route is for platforms that don't support (for whatever reason) cbmem console log.  If it's fatal here; then the script won't run on those platforms; making it impossible to collect the logs with this script. I'm not going to fight it anymore though.
5212,0,I finally found my error!
5213,0,If you do take hold of it; do not hesitate to share :) The original paper and C++ code likewise melt my brain; and I needed the algo in some other place.
5214,0,Perfect would be to have in my CODE_FRAGMENT.

5238,-1,My application links against libsamplerate.a. I am doing this to make distributing the final binary easier. I am worried that perhaps the code inside the .a file depends on some other libraries I also will need to distribute. But if it doesn't I am worried I am bloating up my application too much by including multiple copies of eg. libc. What exactly will be inside libsamplerate.a? Just libsamperate's bytecode? Or more?
5239,-1,Um... Nothing... Sad that we all missed the simple solution.
5240,1,Patch looks good to me.
5241,0,You also do not have to hardcode anything like CODE_FRAGMENT or CODE_FRAGMENT in your reflective code.

I mean in long term vision (e.g. for CouchDB 3.0+). It's oblivious that for 2.x it will also available by old URL and new one (if any). But ok. > jquery.js should stay the way it is as long as we ship Futon. So when we replacing Futon with Fauxton (this will happens anyway) we also stops shipping with jquery.couch.js and his deps; correct? I want to clarify this moment since it is the main of this issue and to be sure that we all thinks about the same. Sorry for such persistent questions! Thanks(:

5247,1,Hi Steve; gentle reminder as per your instructions about reviewing this patch. Thanks!
5248,-1,Can anyone think of a quick; easy and fullproof way of listing only ClearCase Remote Client views from UNIX? ct lsview obviously lists all the views; and you could search by looking at the Properties: section if you run a ct lsview -properties -full (gives you Properties: snapshot webview readwrite) then use a regex or something; but I'd be worried that someone calls their view 'webview' or something. Has anyone got a foolproof way? Am I missing a flag or something? If only there was -fmt on lsview :S
5249,0,Yes; I have been watching OFBIZ-1453 with interest.  I approve of the issue and implementation and didn't have anything to add; so I haven't been involved. The thing I have been thinking about is that there's some assumptions to be made here for pricing and the type of question.  I.e. multiselect questions should display the absolute price.  I'm also trying to work over some other scenarios.  I'll clean up what I have an submit a patch tomorrow.

5256,0,"If we have a class hierarchy with one base class and many subclasses; in most cases it works well to have one base test classes and extended test classes; for each implementation. That way tests that apply to all implementations can go in the base class (and will be run for each sub-test). The ""state system tests"" in lttng2.kernel.tests are like this; and it works very well. Ideally these should be brought back in statesystem.core.tests. InMemoryBackendTest is a good start; but it should split the tests that are common to all backends in a base class. In any case; Backend tests would be great; but it would really be something separate from this patch."

5410,1,Hello George; The fix looks fine; many thanks!
5411,0,I wonder if there are any advantages to your way of doing it over mine; but I think yours will definitely work to detect the error cases I had in mine.
5412,1,>Tilman Hausherr hello; finally it  works! I just downloaded the revision 1535956; and bulded it with Ant. and added the new *.jar to my project's build path. it printed very well. thank you very much.
5413,1,Sure play around it; WP is easy it will just take a bit of time to get used to the structure .
5414,0,Jacopo; Thanks for diving in a pointing Scott at the appropriate screens.
5415,0,the condition !pProfile->m_bIsValid must always be true here; so rather use SAL_WARN
5416,0,Patch applied.
5417,1,Thanks a lot Willem :-)
5418,0,Patches for 1) applied to trunk and J6
5419,1,Thanks Jimmy.
5420,0,I'm developing a mobile application.
5421,0,humans only agree with each other 70% of the time even in polarity sentiment analysis. Jeff's point; while not very encouraging; does accurately reflect how extremely difficult is to get anywhere with this.
5422,-1,Any word on whether it will be fixed?
5423,1,This configuration works very well.
5424,0,However; I'd suggest using a graph visualization library like JUNG etc..
5425,0,http://blog.jerodsanto.net/2009/05/jquery-set-mouse-focus-on-page-load/
5426,0,Undefined doesn't always mean unpredictable. As I said; it's definitely abuse.
5427,0,I haven't touched sharepoint in years. If I want to setup a development environment to get up to speed; what options do I have? I don't have an MSDN license; is there anyway I can get up and running for free? (for development only)
5428,0,The idea was that if we are in the _GCmark phase and a goroutine is no longer _Grunning then do the scan now instead of waiting and doing it in the STW _GCmarktermination phase. Upon reflection I now have concerns about slowing down the preemption. I'm deleting this until we see a valuable use case.
5429,0,The page for subscriber downloads is:
5430,1,Wow; great many thanks! File was Data!
5431,-1,itkGetInputMacro and itkSetInputMacro are ITK wrappers for this->ProcessObject::GetInput(#name) and this->ProcessObject::SetInput(#name) I'm not sure what you think is wrong here; please elaborate.
5432,0,please add tests for fopen; we should test the different modes
5433,0,On the client side; you check the progress every few seconds until you see it's finished.
5434,0,magnus; to write something along the lines of this is the number of sets of the most frequently written output type per frame set. the best default will need some experimentation. ideally this would be a user-configurable option; but it is not clear whether a (hidden) command-line option would be best (or env var); and not clear whether anybody would really use it in practice. Disk is cheaper than user and/or compression time; for the most part. So we'll add a TODO to reconsider for 5.1(?) and not before.
5435,-1,why on earth would it match anything; you have not even touched the Apache install.
5436,0,"OUString::replaceAll does not modify the OUString but returns a new OUString instead. this means that when converting an existing String *Replace* call you need to assign the returned value to the original string. you should get a warning about an ""unused result"" here but strangely i'm not seeing a warning with gcc 4.7; no idea why... at least the Clang tinderbox caught the problem. fixed in commit 03a381eaa58d77cf26dfa8d916d1ecda865c1937"
5437,-1,"It is a core class; why should it be independent from core usage? ""If you just assign an end date you have to jump in the source code to become an idea how the start date is resolved."" This can be written into the function comment; so if we may change $GLOBALS['EXEC_TIME'] we do not need to change so much calls."
5438,0,P.S. Tha last question for this is 4 years old so there is eventually a new solution for modern systems with java8 in combination with a native.
5439,0,if the 2 structures variable are initialied with calloc or they are set with 0 by memset so you can compare your 2 structures with memcmp and there is no worry about structure garbage and this will allow you to earn time
5440,0,all 3 log methods now do make use of the instance variables: accountCache; groupCache; groupBackend
5441,-1,Totally agree. I don't see any good reason why Pig should require 1.6 at this stage. Don't make it harder for the users (and developers under OSX - that includes me) than it already is.
5442,0,You've probably installed VS2010 SP1.
5443,0,And also on the difference between a Connection and a Logical Connection?
5444,1,In my company; we are currently using Qt and are very happy with it. I personnally never had to move a MFC-app into using the Qt framework; but here is something which might be of some interest for you : It's part of Qt-Solutions; so this means you'll have to buy a Qt license along with a Qt-Solutions license. (edit: ) I hope this helps !
5445,0,"Not sure what you mean by ""child form"". Perhaps it's a button on a panel on a form? Or is it a MDI thing? Or is the child form a dialog box?"
5446,-1,My form receives asynchronous callbacks from another object on random worker threads. I have been passing the data to the main thread (where it can be used to update onscreen controls) using delegates as shown below. Performance is dreadful -- once I reach 500 updates per second; the program completely locks up. My GUI processing itself is not the problem; as I can simulate this level of updating within the form and have no problems. Is there a more efficient mechanism I should be using to hand off the data from thread to thread?
5447,0,Guava provides a factory method for decorating each ExecutorService as ListeningExecutorService; so you are free to use whatever ExecutorService you had beforehand.
5448,-1,Since this is correct; why byte code noting down the return type of the called method; and raising error when the library is updated with a return type for the method.
5449,0,I have a CODE_FRAGMENT starting alongside with app.
5450,0,Some further bug tracing shows that pdfbox' RandomAccessBuffer is responsible for the Out of Memory error.
5451,0,In my company; this is a rule to put the constant before a variable for comparison. This rule avoid also to forget a '=' in '==' operator and to create a bug. You can retrieve this rule in ESF project(TIPS-38; https://polarsys.org/wiki/ESF_coding_rules). We think that the same work could be interesting with Papyrus.
5452,1,I understand you need to know the sizes conversion. Sometimes I use this tool: And I found an excellent article about the screen sizes and densities: I hope it will be useful for you!
5453,-1,any reason for not using constants from the enum? if you'll ever change the enum; this tests will produce useless noise.
5454,0,Then shared_pointer is probably the way to go (if you're happy with the cost of refcounting them).
5455,0,Reviewed by Rob.  Approve for 0.20.
5456,0,ThriftServer.java and Hbase.thrift patched manually; the other files generated using thrift-0.2.0
5457,1,"Although I didn't technically end up escaping the dot; your suggestion actually did make me realize another alternative. While wondering how I would ""pass"" the escape code to the ""SQL"" server; it dawned on me: Why not use a ""SQL Pass-Through Query"" instead of an ODBC linked table? Since I only need read access to the SQL Server data; it works fine! Thanks!"
5458,0,+1; looks good.
5459,0,Guess I'll be trying to find a creative workaround in the meantime... The proximate cause of the failure is that there are more than 5 levels of subdirectories under.
5460,-1,I use festAssertions in my tests and I noticed that using yields different results than in tests where hibernate objects are tested. I had to do workaround and now test looks really ugly but I cannot use because that just does not work! Here is partial code(look at last line): seasonRate; seasonRate1 are created and persisted. Then retrieved from db and checked against originals. Nothing fancy; but does not work with festAssertions. Do you have any idea how to fix that and if it is some error on my side or not?
5461,0,Update the pom for itest to include ws-void-args-return This patch fixes TUSCANY-1658 and TUSCANY-1653; and add an itest to verify the fix.
5462,1,Great! Thank you.
5463,0,Is there any reason you can't give the list a specified width?
5464,-1,Never been this frustrated before... I HATE UIs! Will have to deal with them one day
5465,1,Just a personal opinion; not an actual answer but... I love those login forms (not pages) which just shows up in the center of the page and after you type in your username and password you are logged in without ever leaving the current page!
5466,1,Excellent! Can you post it as an answer?
5467,0,If I understand this right the buildr process is able to load Java classes dynamically and invoke them with reflection? That does it make it slightly easier to do some complex steps.
5468,0,Here is what the content of FILE_NAME ended up looking like.
5469,1,Excellent; thanks!
5470,1,Ok cool; this is just a matter of adding strings to the various [NotFound()|https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/0.15.0-rc4/src/files/files.cpp#L160] returns in files.cpp There are a number of error cases in the [browse|https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/0.15.0-rc4/src/files/files.cpp#L204] and [read|https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/0.15.0-rc4/src/files/files.cpp#L204] endpoints; I'd imagine one could change the javascript to generate bad requests which should be sufficient to test this :)
5471,1,Thanks for the info David.
5472,0,I know that; that's why I wrote unsupported (exclamation mark). It was just meant as an aside and isn't central to the question.
5473,0,(style)  code indent should use tabs where possible
5474,0,Another alternative might be to make a little icon + onhover that displays the non-comma'ed value and change the default display to comma'ed?
5475,1,First off I'm really loving all the things you can do with CouchDB. I'm coming from a lot of front end JavaScript and I use console.log() for lots of debugging and testing tasks. I'm wondering how to console.log or what a better way to debug might be in CouchDB. Any suggestions would be really awesome!
5476,0,Has anyone built a website with IronPython and ASP.NET. What were your experiences and is the combination ready for prime-time?
5477,-1,Any idea what i might be doing wrong.
5478,0,However; I also run into the opposite problem.
5479,1,Hi Sandy; Thanks so much to give me such comments; that's really helpful; I will update this later.
5480,0,Removed version-infomation znode.
5481,0,I hope the first approach as the more general solution will work though :)
5482,1,Excellent question! I know this is an old post; but it saved me on a big project I am working on... so; thanks!
5483,1,Thanks Thomas!
5484,0,Wrong JIRA...please ignore my previous comment.

5486,0,Thank you very much Les.
5487,1,Patch committed to trunk. Thanks Niraj.
5488,0,This needs a  (void)e; added for the non-dbgutil build to not bail out with werror; doesn't it?
5489,0,Hullo?
5490,0,"What do you mean ""outside MVC""? If you're that worried about it; type out the full class name!"
5491,0,Plus; of course you don't have to hardcode the name of the jarfile.
5492,-1,To be honest I don't even know where to start. I guess the solution might entail using a zillion IIf statements. I'm fairly new to this I'm afraid!
5493,1,Jeff's article is excellent reading on this topic.

5500,1,Apple's MapCallouts code sample demonstrates how do do this with the callout and their Weather Map sample shows how to do custom annotation views. There documentation is really excellent and these samples are both helpful.

5508,0,"bq. Hmmm; infoStream is just for debugging... should we really make it volatile? I'll remove its volatile... Oh yeah.  But then we'd clone the full IWC on every set... this seems like overkill in the name of ""purity"". I really don't like that this approach would split IW configuration into two places.  Like you look at the javadocs for IWC and think that you cannot change the RAM buffer size. IWC should be the one place you go to see which settings you can change about the IW.  That some of these settings take effect ""live"" while others do not is really an orthogonal (and I think; secondary; ie handled fine w/ jdocs) aspect/concern."
5509,0,I am using a regex that would basically regex for the following URL.
5510,0,i don't think that any special filtering should be performed for the access control content such as e.g. rep:policy nodes. but as far as i can see; you didn't incorporate this into the patch; right? testing for Tree#exists in the NodeDelegate looks ok to me...

5545,1,I need someone to point me in the right direction on this.... In my Android application I have a ListView with custom views for each row containing various textviews each. I retrieve weather information for multiple locations and then want to write the results for each location to its own listview item. The question is; how do I refer to each textview on each listview item? I can't do it by name using ; can I? If there are three items in the list; will the temperature textview for each item be names the same; just differ by an array index? If so; how do I specify TextViewName(0); TextViewName(1) and TextViewName (2) for the three list items? Yes; I'm still very new to Android....but loving it!
5546,1,I am trying to make my javascript change when the window resizes; but cannot seem to get it to work.

Yet we have a flash questionnaire that is being wrecked from users who use refresh. I also already have js in place that effectively blocks refresh; UNTIL the flash gets focus and the user presses refresh. I have access to the Flash through our Flash developer; but he is uncertain of how to do this. The closest we could come up with was to use the fscommand trapallkeys; yet it does not appear to be working.

5588,0,Resolving the issue as the patch was applied to Airavata trunk.
5589,1,I'm still not in love with the sarcasm or excessive negativity.  I'll just point a few things out. 1/ I didn't veto anything; and this has nothing to do with C++.  I think it is a bad idea for us to generate code in a way that causes semantics to silently change when a new optional field is added.  This in dangerous in the long term. 2/ I have no problem reverting this change. 3/ Restoring the old constructor and marking in deprecated is probably a good idea.

5600,-1,"I tested this code out with an Access 2007 database with no exceptions (I went as high as 13000 inserts). However; what I noticed is that it is terribly slow as you are creating a connection every time. If you put the ""using(connection)"" outside the loop; it goes much faster."
5601,0,Then you can do what you want with the Collection: sort it; loop through it; create a Comparator etc..
5602,0,Does this applies to 0.22 trunk or 0.23 trunk?
5603,0,If we put this jar to bootclasspath we'll have at least 5% performance boost on HWA application .

5605,0,Hi guys; I agree 100% on this.
5606,1,I am creating a small widget and I want to allow others to use it. The iFrame is loaded from HTTP - but I want to allow users to login via HTTPS i.e. that is - send a request for login via SSL Is this allowed within the same-origin policies or ? i.e. the scenario is that a user can integrate my javascript to their website; the widget opens and i want to allow them to login via https ? Any help would be hugely appreciated :)
5607,0,Note that the GUI's CODE_FRAGMENT can update arbitrary components; and the progress bar can be customized.
5608,0,I agree with Erik the message is an non-issue and can stay as is. I was just curious about the plan to merge the other two commits. But even that doesn't really matter.
5609,1,@PhilipOakley excellent suggestion! I hadn't used `cherry-pick` before but that worked quite well. If you post as an answer I'll accept.
5610,0,I try make authentication using But I get . How I should correct my code?
5611,1,what I am trying to do it show what terminal port im useing when I am currently logged in to my linux server. If anyone could offer some help I would be very greatfull!! thanks
5612,0,Thanks.
5613,1,"That's funny; this is exactly what I am attempting to figure out the best way to do at the moment. I had thought of using a ViewStack; but as I already have a lot of other nested ViewStacks being used; I was also looking into the State tag. If anyone knows ""the right thing"" to do I'll be very interested too!"
5614,0,In the follow-up change [1] this method is renamed to 'canEditChangeLabels' [2]. I would propose to name it already here 'canEditChangeLabels' so that it doesn't need to be renamed in the next change.

5616,0,Vinicus patch only includes a single file (the failing junit); all Uwe need to do is to apply the patch to the moved file; is that correct?
5617,0,"Yes it could be done but we will have to add level number for each valid level. I don't know it will cost more or less than just ""0"" for each invalid level because normally for now all level are valid."
5618,0,For the authentication issue; it's recorded in JAMES-1418 (I will try to look at it this weekend).
5619,1,+1 for the excellent approximation!
5620,1,the code has been checked in. Thanks to Gordon for that.

5624,1,I want to know what is good start point to work on creating own GUI on iphone/objective-c. I've never done this part before; and I know I'm kinda attracted to make my own slick GUI; something like convertbot; which I really love :) Any suggestion would be appreciated! Thanks
5625,1,Looking forward to your patch.
5626,0,you could use.
5627,0,Marco; I've fixed some minor issues in your patch (including the one you have pointed out) and I've committed it.

5632,0,Hello; I see Uwe has commented on SOLR-1657 that he would help convert tokenstreams to the new api; but he needs this patch (the tests) applied first.
5633,1,Excellent answer. This should be the selected answer.
5634,0,I logged a new ticket HADOOP-9280 as this is critical problem for people trying to upgrade from 0.2 to 1.x
5635,-1,yes it does it in IE8 as well. Very annoying !
5636,-1,Hey Vikram-- sorry about that; I haven't paid much attention to this issue.
5637,1,+1 thanks
5638,1,I've had great success with DockPanelSuite I may post some sample code to get you started but it's fairly staright forward!
5639,1,That's a great link! Donut caching; when using the WebFormViewEngine also works with the declarative control too.
5640,0,<pctony> This has been done.  It should work just fine; I'll be doing some more work on JIRA later; and will force a re-index then; so this might look better after that. Have a look around.

5644,-1,bq. 1)  Sorry; didn't create a patch for the README since it was a small change; it is included in this patch with the comment revision.

5656,0,THis is now resolved and pushed to npm as 3.0.1. Uses npm's proxy configs in lazy-load module.
5657,1,Hey Tom; The change in your patch looks good. Latest patch just updates two tests. I'll commit this if Hudson comes back OK. Thanks; Eli
5658,0,I had a further thought about this; because the kind of people who use old school css are the kind of people who could get stung by this. How about we add individual .gitignore files to each theme that has a gulpfile (including subthemestarter) and I can add something to the theming docs for using normal CSS to say 'delete the gitignore file'?

5661,0,"Is ""how many times have *""; I updated the comment. Note that the nstglobalcomm removal is not directly related to this patch; but that was uncorrect; since nstglobalcomm counts in MD steps; whereas n_load_have counts DD partitionings. 100 might be a bit high for short runs; but for any longer run DLB will still trigger within a very small fraction of the total runtime."
5662,1,Excellent work on that site by the way!
5663,0,You may want to check CODE_FRAGMENT.
5664,0,Replaced J2eeContextImpl.newContext(...) to J2eeContextImpl.newModuleContext(...)
5665,1,Closing based on comments from Matt. Thank you.
5666,-1,no; it is extremely bad idea.
5667,0,To obtain those kinds of damages; a copyright notice is required. 
5668,0,Looks fine; thanks.
5669,0,The idea behind this is largely the same as with our existing package structure - there is nothing technical in preventing *everything* to be in the org.apache.jspwiki -namespace (with no subpackages); but both aesthetics and experience tell us that it just makes sense to add subpackages to make class management easier.
5670,-1,As Alexander said; you are comparing a string and a char. The sad thing is that the compiler already told you that; only it encrypted it in ISO-STL-TEMPLATE encryption; which is more difficult to read that perl! You may want to look at for decrypting C++ STL error messages.
5671,0,Or there are any better approach for this?
5672,0,We have done pretty intensive testing and believe this fixes the problem.
5673,0,But both of those look fine to me.
5674,0,I've been using for a little while now; but there's one glaring piece of functionality that is either missing or I just can't figure out (I hope the latter!). If you pass cfg.getTemplate() an absolute path; it just doesn't work. I know you can specify a template directory; but I can't afford to do that; my use case could deal with files in any directory. Is there any way to set FreeMarker to render absolute paths the way any user would expect?
5675,0,+1 to what Esteban said.
5676,0,IIRC; the max baud was effectively limited only by the H/W - I wrote my config to allow up to 1.3Mb; but I was targeting modems over RS-232 so 115K was the max that I needed; and likely the max that I ever will.
5677,0,Added patch to support configuration mapping
5678,1,+1. Great question! Now; I have no clue about the answer; but I'll stay tuned.
5679,1,That works! Very awesome :) How do I select your answer as the solution?
5680,0,It's up to the implementation ( which will depend on the kind of input stream you're using ); but generally it's likely to use a blocking OS-level API; so the efficiency will depend on the OS.
5681,0,My code is as follows.
5682,0,Something along the lines of.
5683,1,"Everytime I create a new IK handle in Maya via MEL; it creates an end effector named ""effector1""; or ""effector2""; depending on what is in my scene. I don't want to rely on the auto-name of the end effector; so I'm wondering if there is a way to either: a) name the effector at the create-time of the IK handle; or b) select the effector for a particular IK handle in MEL. Any help would be greatly appreciated -- thanks!"
5684,0,I just committed this.
5685,-1, We should not invoke the global synced fieldnumbers shit for every element; only when the setting actually changes
5686,1,Applied patch with thanks to Chris.
5687,0,We need refresh freq_demote = defrag->tier_demote_frequency; here; otherwise we won't be able to change the frequency from the CLI.
5688,0,Doc string needs to be changed. This does not return anything. it can be something like- This function verify detail of referenced datastore.
5689,0,We have different disk sizes on our DNs.
5690,0,I am not sure if it does; I will check into that. That may be the solution I need.
5691,0,"So; I also can say ""this is not yield keyword specific problem""."
5692,0,not to worry; it was a permissions issue with the file!
5693,0,Please justify why no new tests are needed for this patch.
5694,0,The final CODE_FRAGMENT should look like.
5695,-1,It's not possible to open the page in full screen without user interaction (clicking on a button etc.) because it would be extremely annoying.
5696,0,I don't have the cycles today.
5697,-1,I have a controller which has a few actions; which are triggered by hitting various buttons on the page. I would like to have a default action; but am unsure how to annotate the method. Here is an example: How can I annotate a method which will act on a POST with any submit button pressed with no key selected? I have tried: I'd really hate it if I had to set required = false on each of the methods which take RequestParams and then conditionally check to see if one comes in or not... Is there a way to annotate this to work properly?
5698,0,Applied combined patch from Shiva and BJ at r692233.
5699,1,+1. Looks god. Thanks for making it better.
5700,0,Alejandro Abdelnur; sorry I don't get it; what history you want to keep?
5701,0,@Cocowalla The CLR does not manage native resources. However; if a process terminates; all handles are freed by the system (the OS; not the CLR).
5702,0,I haven't done this before; but I found on the web giving an explanation.
5703,1,Excellent workaround..!

5706,-1,Forget the patch for the moment.
5707,-1,I asked before about pixel-pushing; and have now managed to get far enough to get noise to show up on the screen. Here's how I init: Here's how I render each frame: Problem is this is awfully awfully slow; around 5fps. I think my path to publish the buffer must be wrong. Is it even possible to do full-screen pixel-based graphics that I could update at 30fps; without using the 3D chip?
5708,0,They cannot afford to do it frequently.
5709,-1,Sorry; yes I believe this has been resolved.
5710,0,I have a page with many forms in panels and usercontrols; and a requiredfield validator I just added to one form is preventing all of my other forms from submitting. what's the rule that I'm not following?
5711,0,"Should we set ""io->ci_ignore_layout = 1"" under such case? then subsequent layout processing can be ignored."
5712,0,Make it work with all browsers up front. This will mean extra testing during development but will cause you less pain later. I find it's usually easier to diagnose problems if I've just developed the thing; rather than coming back later and trying to figure it out...along with a list of other issues.
5713,0,I want to fetch data from webservice and want to display it in to databse
5714,0,Using CODE_FRAGMENT;.
5715,1,Wow; I've just had a look at the Corona SDK. It looks excellent! A really intuitive way to build apps. Thanks for the tip!
5716,1,Your best bet is probably TcpClient. There's a great sample that does exactly what you're doing right in the .NET Documentation here: Good luck to you!
5717,-1,...except for the fact that get_initial_timestamp() doesn't exist for Fam10h; and implementation looks non-trivial.
5718,0,Robin is fixing some other things w/ NB; so he's going to take this.
5719,0,In Sql Server 2005; set auto create statistics and auto update statistics. You won't have to worry about creating them or maintaining them yourself; since the database handles this very well itself.
5720,1,change the following to: to Added in the select; also ensure that DATABASE_TABLE has the column _id.A cursor adapter will always need an column!Hope that helps.!
5721,1,I always recommend for a good starting point for beginners - especially those who have seen SQL but never understood how to build up a query them selves or how they work. All Celko's books are great. Hernandez's Mere Mortals book is good. Ken Henderson's books are also excellent.
5722,0,Some comments: The new method added to Namesystem is better to # pass BlockInfoUnderConstruction; # call it as isInSnapshot; and # do not throw IOException.
5723,-1,This is probably silly but very frustrating. Using VS2008 with a C++ project; when I'm working normally; the breakpoints window is visible and active but when I'm debugging it disappears and can't be shown. This is a problem if I want to edit the condition of a breakpoint while running. Pressing the breakpoints window button doesn't do anything and neither does pressing Ctrl+Alt+B Does this happen to anybody else? It's a brand new install with Visual Assist and QT integration as extensions. same configuration with VS2005 doesn't have any problems.
5724,1,been trying to save my data from my while loop to script variables but no success. Did an example if how I want to save my php data to script variables. This doesn't work for me. Anyone have any idea? Don't want to save all data manually. Very greatful for answers! Ask if you don't understand :)
5725,-1,The screen which shows whenever i start Netbeans is very annoying; and among the hundreds of options I can't find the one which turns it off?
5726,0,I'd probably make this _parseMemInfo. If we see that we need it outside this module we can always drop the leading underscore.
5727,0,I am using batik library to create pdf document from svg file.
5728,1,Hi Leon; thanks i'll take a look. Anyway i thought of refactoring this parsing mechanism; we can do better :-). Cheers Sascha

5730,0,Thanks.
5731,0,Patch in gzipped form.
5732,1,Here is the working solution.. Tested in Chrome/FireFox/Safari.. Split the setter into a separate method. Working grrrrreat! Enjoy... Controller: View:
5733,0,Solution looks as follows: when doing a cluster sync; whether it is for reading or writing; always acquire the version manager's read lock first.
5734,0,question for me: every time; I ask me when we need to put [1.2.0;) why we do not use it?
5735,-1,@afr0 I'm afraid I don't understand what you mean! That example is using an ajax call when creating a ProductViewModel object to get the data.
5736,0,Will commit it today evening.
5737,0,"Maybe TestChanges? *I prefer FooBar over BarForFoo *""Util"" is redundant with the package name *TestFoo says ""implementation (e.g. fake) of Foo for tests"" while TestFoos says ""static methods for dealing with Foos"" It's not super compelling; but hey; at least it's shorter."
5738,-1,Based mostly on ; but also ; and my own experience; I don't think it's possible without a lot of ugliness; pain or without converting your LINQ to SQL code generation over to (not appealing; IMO).
5739,0,Hmm; couldn't we make QtAndroid private API in QtCore or sth like that?
5740,-1,We in the process of building an IOS app (it's yet to be launched). We are trying to implement Push Notifications as part of the build. We have set this up via Amazon SNS and have created and registered an app certificate for the app which contains push notification permissions. Basically we send the app message from Server code - it states that it has been published and it returns the message ID but the device doesn't receive anything. To clarify the device registers ok for remote notifications and returns a device token. Very frustrating! Does anyone have any tips?
5741,0,In the new version; elements have two methods - render(); which draws them; and apply() which initialises shared properties like colour.
5742,1,Hi Suran; The new catalogs_b.patch looks very good.
5743,0,How do I achieve this?
5744,1,Ruth; patch applied at r526665; thanks a lot for this enhancement; please verify; thanks.

The colon seems implied by the <dt>; I'm not sure whether it should be added in the messages or with CSS or just left implied; or if we should have these be punctuated as sentences and ignore the semantically-implied colon."
5746,1,A patch for this. Thanks a lot.
5747,0,Use float or double.
5748,0,I can't reproduce this error.  I also can't properly navigate in your example since the UI doesn't properly work on a Nexus 4.  Tried on the Nexus 10; but your splash screen took too long.
5749,0,Thread 2 iterates CODE_FRAGMENT and finds matching records by calling CODE_FRAGMENT; iterating the submap; giving matching CODE_FRAGMENT and CODE_FRAGMENT records to thread 3 for processing.
5750,0,How do you manage deploying InfoPath forms to different sharepoint servers? Is there a better way to deal all the data connections being site-specific without opening the forms; editing the data connections and republishing for each environment?
5751,-1,My bad.
5752,0,I do have a patch; but unfortunately I am not a position to sign the CLA.
5753,1,"Thanks Tucu! You are right. I had not thought of that. I'm on the fence because we are serializing a process which should happen fast (so parallelizing is good). Like you already mentioned bq. 1* Add a method in the FileSystem to disable its shutdown hook. MRAppMaster would disable it and call closeAll() explicitly (it already does). This is already present (by setting conf.setBoolean(""fs.automatic.close""; false) ) So I'm not sure what problem this JIRA is fixing. Or are we planning for the future? I'm fine with the latter answer being yes. I'm just curious. The patch looks good for what it intends to do; although the latest one doesn't include the fixes you made in response to Nicholas' comments."
5754,0,Perhaps; throwing IOException is going to prevent us from a situation where we end up with a deadlock.
5755,0,An example is as follows.
5756,1,committed; thanks!
5757,0,So; i'm going to make a patch that does 1G regions and 128M flushes (with the multiplier still of x2 so we'll grow to 256M before the barrier comes down).
5758,1,Thanks. That was a really great pointer!
5759,0,Are you using Hibernate or similar to interface the database?
5760,0,This entire change is probably moot if the corresponding aFunkMarkExt was passed to the ctor; see comment in viewfunc.cxx
5761,-1,Forgot about these; sorry.
5762,0,If so; that's a pretty bad admin experience.
5763,0,add keyword [PATCH] to description.
5764,0,Please explain on why it is been taken out from the switch case below.
5765,0,"Trying to swap the layout when obj1 == obj2 should just ""return 0"" (i.e. be no-op).  There should also be a check that the two objects have the same uid and gid; and that the UID doing the swap is either owner or has mdd_capable(uc; CAP_FOWNER) since this would ensure the process isn't trying to steal data (i.e. the process doing this could read and overwrite the data if it wanted)."
5766,0,changed to prefix operator++ (and further down in the code; too) I had it mostly coded with date serial numbers; but had to make functions that are available for class Date. I could only find appropiate date serial number functions in the sc/addin/analysis module; a module that I would rather move entirely to the 'normal' calc function module once the Excel-analysis-addin can be considered obsolete. IMHO that would reduce the complexity of the calc-function code. I will peg Date to date serial number conversion as a toDo item on my lo-task stack.
5767,-1,Data loss.

5797,1,There's 2 parts to this question; both about RestKit: How can we post up 2 values email and password; and deal with the response using the object mapper How can we map 2 objects in a response We are expecting the following JSON response: What's the correct way to map this out; we've got a class setup for User and Token; but all the examples i've seen seem to not show something like this where there is two segments to the response; here's the code we have at the moment: Appreciate any help you can give on this; loving RestKit so far!
5798,0,Attaching patch for review.
5799,1,I just committed this to both trunk and MR-279. Thanks Jeffrey!
5800,0,commit.hashCode() should be sufficient. A commit can only have one author.
5801,-1,hmm; why this should be a problem? attr is a local (to this thread) storage; nobody else will see that?
5802,0,I far prefer the load/store naming since anybody who has ever worked with SIMD will know exactly what we're doing. The point is to maybe make the SIMD code slightly less cluttered; and _maybe_ make it possible to for some simple routines to be templated; not to design a new language.
5803,-1,In this case; data would pretty much just silently be lost.
5804,1,patch applied - thanks!
5805,-1,"You have two divs; one over the other; and the one on top is transparent. However; when you scroll you want the div on the bottom to hide as it goes under the first transparent div. You don't want the second div's to change to as soon as it goes under the first div. You just want the part that is under to be hidden. I've googled extensively for an answer: #1-4 answer make the div on top or . The problem with this for me is my background is a photograph; i.e. as you scroll down what you see is different; as opposed to a colour or a pattern. The ""background"" of the transparent div needs to change as the real background changes. #5 offers a solution to this using JQuery however there are horrible; horrible issues with scroll lag in browsers not Firefox. Folks; how do I do it?"
5806,-1,I now have this extremely ugly solution. Anybody a better idea?
5807,0,This may be well known problem in i18n in typography ....
5808,0,lint is constantly updated... so why would you want a more recent one. BTW flexelint is lint
5809,0,Anyway; created a patch ... 
5810,-1,You could use an incredibly ugly workaround and set a form full of hidden fields to submit when you click a link. I really wouldn't recommended it though.
5811,1,Thanks for the work Haohui! I've committed it to branch-1.
5812,0,No; that not required/related.
5813,1,That would be very awesome; thanks! If you do post it I will likely contribute...
5814,-1,Can I fix the width and the height of jQueryMobile dialog? Currently; the size of width is 100% which is really awful in iPad.
5815,1,It's not a place; but I've found by Charles Petzold excellent. It covers everything you ask about and is focused specifically on WPF/silverlight. Of course Petzold (as usual) is able to communicate the important concepts beautifully.
5816,1,This is better than mine. Didn't know you could do a string array for formats. Very nice!
5817,0,"I think your question would be more appropriately phrased as ""What are some recommended ways to handle auditing in a database?"""
5818,0,[error] Unused import - java.lang.ClassCastException.
5819,1,I suspect it may be more efficient to both query and write your records within each CODE_FRAGMENT; but this is an assumption that would likely require testing.
5820,0,There is a bug in PayloadNearQuery. If there are multiple top level spans that match the query; only the payloads of the first one are retrieved. This patch fixes this bug by iterating over all the top level spans to get the payloads (see 'setFreqCurrentDoc') > The base explain method can't be abstract. Something like Ah; right. This is included in the patch >The changes don't seem thread safe any more since there are now member variables. It may still be all right; but have you looked at this aspect? I guess that could be said about PayloadTermSpanScorer and PayloadNearSpanScorer; too (payloadScore; payloadsSeen). As for the PayloadFunction classes; they seem lightweight enough to be created with each query. Is there a better pattern? Peter
5821,0,Typo:  surfix -> suffix
5822,1,Hi Chris; Thanks for your detailed response. Thanks;
5823,0,Is there any way we could implement vertical lines in a jquery file tree?
5824,0,It's uploaded here and on review board.
5825,0,We need a proper JUnit test for this!
5826,0,Have you taken a look at [remotefs](http://remotefs.netbeans.org/)?
5827,1,Excellent method for minor changes. Just what I was looking for. Thank you.
5828,0,Ensure FILE_NAME contains CODE_FRAGMENT or that your manifest hierarchy points to FILE_NAME that contains FILE_NAME.
5829,0,Unless you start using Maven or a similar dependency management tool.
5830,0,C# syntax is so close to Java (and better in some ways) that you might as well learn C# instead of J#. And since C# is more widely used; you can easily find Java --> C# tutorials on google or check out and watch some videos.
5831,0,"Does time_sec_to_str ""format"" the field better than an FT_UINT16?  Or does it just add an ""s"" to the value (which you may want to keep for consistency)."
5832,0,Closing; works like charm now.
5833,1,killed that process and restarted and it worked!
5834,-1,Incidentally if we all nag Joe Walnes enough we might be able to persuade him to release a new qdox which can ignore annotations etc (though it will still struggle with generics I think)
5835,0,An CODE_FRAGMENT is.
5836,-1,I think I've been using these terms interchangably / wrongly!
5837,-1,This is an absurd; unreasonable and frankly ridiculous requirement; I can't imagine what use such a data structure would be good for.
5838,0,I wouldn't class that a problem. If you structure things in a meaningful way; you should be able to look at the JS; see where all the event hooks are. If you're worried too much about it; you *could* set the rel attr to js; or prepent the ID with js_; etc.
5839,0,v2 removes some dross included by misstack.
5840,-1,First of all I can't see object locking; unused lockObject variable makes me sad. IEnumerable is not special. Each thread will have it's own copy of reference to some instance of sektioner object. You can't affect other threads that way. What would happen with old version of data pointed by sektioner field largely depends on calling party.
5841,1,Nadya; Thanks a lot for applying the patch. The changes are on the site. Everything looks the way it should. IMHO; we should close the issue now. P.S. forgot to mention other changes. Sorry. Will be more attentive in future.
5842,0,Thanks; Jothi!
5843,0,Url points to a tesco advert
5844,1,Hello Andreas; Thank you for the information. Shall try the same and upload the patch shortly. Thanks & Regards; Ravikiran Mane.
5845,0,Where do they live then? And then shouldn't we remove VBOOT_CFLAGS here?
5846,1,Short and to the point... excellent! +1
5847,-1,I've always been a bit frightened of Python. Is it not a relatively massive leap from an ingrained Web development mindset?
5848,-1,Here is quite bad.

5856,1,Creating custom types can be done in PowerShell. Kirk Munro actually has two great posts that detail the process thoroughly. The book also has a code sample for creating a domain specific language to create custom types. The book is excellent all around; so I really recommend it. If you are just looking for a quick way to do the above; you could create a function to create the custom object like

5859,0,Is there any difference between: and The convention that I've seen in most Python code (and the code I myself write) is the former; but I recently came across code which uses the latter. None is an instance (and the only instance; IIRC) of NoneType; so it shouldn't matter; right? Are there any circumstances in which it might?

5882,0,+1 Looks good to me.
5883,0,I assume you're using Ken Reitz's excellent requests library to do the HTTP requests (if not; you really should be!)Most likely; the problem is that requests doesn't add a 'Content-type' header to multi-part uploads; and packmgr doesn't read multi-part bodies with no 'Content-type' header. So; while a normal 'requests' POST of a multipart-encoded file would go something like this: you instead have to use the longer form; setting an explicit content-type: Note that one side-effect of doing it this way is that it cannot stream the file - the entire package ZIP file will be read into memory.

5896,0,well; since we're doing this; might as well do this instead; since it's cleaner and looks better (and sanitized).         elements = getattr(self._conn; class_name)(ElementName=element_name)         data = self._get_first_item(elements) And before you dismiss the usage of getattr; That's actually how wmi namespaces work: the __getattr__ method is overriden and it will lookup and cache that class_name and return it; as it does not have it defined. This way it is more flexible; same wmi module works for any namespace.

5922,0,The doxygen  documentation will also be a bit better if you add   \related ArrayRef to these functions (and similarly for the ConstArrayRef ones).
5923,0,When we have a cluster of machines behind a load balancer (lb); generally hardware load balancer have persistent connections; Now when we need to deploy some update on all machines (rolling update); the way to do is by bringing one machine Out of rotation; looks for no request sent to that server via lb. When the app reached no request state then update manually. With 70-80 servers in picture this becomes very painful. Can someone have a better way of doing it.
5924,-1,In Sublime Text 2; if I press escape the page goes into COMMAND mode; which seems to take text input as commands; rather than actually typing the text. Another oddity is the VISUAL mode; and I have no idea what it does besides it seems to highlight text. I think they came installed with the theme that I got; 'soda'; maybe. Anyway; I searched and found out you can turn off COMMAND mode by pressing 'i'. Regardless; both of these modes are extremely annoying; how do I get rid of them?

5932,-1,This is a method in Java; that(when k == 0) in int[] arr has one of k-combination int[] intems. In variable iloczyn is calculated product of elements in this combination. In tmp is calculated sum of all such products. Unfortunately; System.out.println(tmp) shows; that when function ends; tmp equals 0. This is very sad; because i need this variable for next calculations. What shoud I do?
5933,0,And then MarkupCache uses that interface to checkout what the actual file is I dont think we will get IResourceStream implementation that are not File or URL and if we do then we fallback on the cachekey only approache.

I am under the impression that with the right javascript framework; anything in .NET GUI can be replicated. While I am still researching this point; I would like to ask if form features in .NET GUI can in fact be replicated with javascript and slightly more importantly; will it take much longer to develop to get the same results?

5988,0,It works for me; both in container and in testing with WicketTester.
5989,1,Excellent! Thanks for the link.
5990,-1,I have a somewhat complicated issue. I have a grid defined (using the Struts2-JQuery Grid Plugin). One of the columns has a custom formatter that calls a Javascript function to put a button into that column. (Note: I absolutely HATE doing it that way). The point of the button is to open up a dialog box. This dialog box contains a checkboxlist; which can't be rendered in the grid. Somehow; I need to pass a parameter to the action that returns the view that will be displayed inside the dialog. Since this is somewhat complex; here is the code: Grid definition: Javascript Custom Formatter: Dialog Definition: Remote Manage Roles JSP (trimmed): Since I get the id of the grid object via javascript; but use the JSP taglib for the dialog; how can I pass the id around?
5991,0,"The word ""Selected"" should be capitalized. I'm unsure of the use of ""Area"" here; BTW. Maybe ""Cut Selection""?"

5996,0,To be quite blunt guys; your log4net logger methods smell bad.
5997,0,"what's the rationale for dropping the odd ""& 0xFF"" here but not in other places?"
5998,0,On second sought: actually you don't need this file (endpoint) at all. We have already POST /changes that creates a change and what are you doing here is to delegate to its apply() method; after translating your own Input to ChangeInfo. The only reason to have this class is to get the UiAction for granted (Guice DynamicItem binding and discovery). But you could solve this in different way: just construct UiAction on you own in ProjectJson and add it to actions map manually. See an example how it's done in InlineEdit series: [1]. Now; on the client side; from your custom UiAction you can invoke the original REST endpoint: POST /changes. The only difference to current solution: you would need to pass project name too; obviously. This also raises the question do we want to have this button on project info screen at all? We could add it to main page (or may be just add a keyboard shortcut); in wich case we are not in project context any more and the dialog must be extended to provide project name (with suggestion oracle for project; like it already does for branches). I don't have strong preference for one of these solutions. So; you can let it as is for now and wait for opinion of other reveiwers.

6004,0,Is this only relevant for new Js interop or was it also a bug with regular JSOs? If it was a bug with JSOs; we should add the relevant regression test.

6018,0,Could we encapsulate the 64BITHASH functionality into the FULL20 flag? I believe there are only two minor issues that are currently handled under FULL20; and both would be easy to fix in the 1.8 branch as well if we want to add support for 64 hash values there. 1) client must zero the o_gr field in all OST requests 2) client must compute the early reply checksum on the full reply buffer size instead of a fixed size (88 bytes; IIRC)

6026,0,If using a numeric key; make sure the datatype is giong to be large enough to hold the number of rows you might expect the table to grow to. If using a guid; does the extra space needed to store the guid need to be considered? Will coding against guid PKs be a pain for developers or users of the application. If using composite keys; are you sure that the combined columns will always be unique?
6027,0,All the changes are correct.
6028,0,I guess the gen stamp is unnecessary; but the DN isn't going to automatically mlock newly appended data; so the NN needs to somehow realize that the cached length is shorter than the new length and ask the DN to recache at the new length.

6031,0,We decided not to support jdk13 jvms with 10.3; so there's no point in attempting to change anything at this point.
6032,0,> Do you think attached patch is generic? Nothing is generic until it's used in more than one place.  The above isn't complete (it needs; e.g.; 'read()' and 'seek()' implementations) but it looks like a good start.  But the real question is to you: could you use the above?  Can you present the data and checksums as input streams that support read(byte[]; int; int) and seek(long)? It also assumes a particular checksum implementation; CRC32.  If we wish to allow for others; that aspect could be generalized by adding a codec-like interface for checksummers.  But I think we should probably skip that this iteration.

The patch does not apply cleanly especially UberspectImpl & Introspector. The ""best"" approach I've found yet is to force apply updates even if patch thinks it may have already been applied. Then; for each of them; copy/paste the '.rej' content replacing the end of the original file with the content at the proper place; a quick regexp replace with '^+ ' to get rid of these '+' and it should be ok. I wish I had a way to generate patches guaranteed to apply (a tool that would apply the patch to the original file & if rejects are found; re-create a patch for this file that replaces the whole content - delete all original content; add all new content - with the new one....)"

6139,0,I think that's absolutely terrible practice. First of all you do not need to make the trip to the server to hide and show controls; unless you need new data. Second; any decent javascript framework will allow you to hide show controls based on the control's id; class name; or whatever css selector. Moreover using a javascript post/get to a generic handler will give you the data that you need without the postback. I'd suggest using JQuery; or some other alternative.

So if the users selects the 'gold' attribute in the widget; the gold thumbnails should display in the archive. Using ACF I added image fields to the main product for thumbnails and modified the action in my functions.php. I am trying to write a function that will retrieve the right thumbnail for the currently viewed filter but I cant find a way to check the active attribute for the page.

6218,0,In terms of performance and optimizations: When constructing a table in SQL Server; does it matter what order I put the columns in? Does it matter if my primary key is the first column?

If not; how can I move a column to a difference position?

6222,0,Have you considered overriding the administrative templates for the models in question? This provides an excellent overview of the process. In this particular situation; having a finer-grained level of control may be the best way to achieve the desired result.
6223,0,(I'm assuming you don't have a DMR.)There is no easy/clean way to do this in Cognos. In your query; you'll have to build a calculation for each year in your output. So; something like this for 2013: And basically the same for 2014.Cut the Trans piece out of your crossab. Then you'll nest those two calcs under your years. To get rid of all the zeroes or nulls; select the two columns. From the menu; select ; ; .Finally; you will drop a calc in next to your Years in the crosstab (not under them). The expression will be (or whatever you end up naming your calcs). Format it as a percent; and you should be good to go.Told you it was a pain!

6232,0,I don't think it's a matter of which language is better. In the .NET world there are some inconsistencies between the libraries different languages provide. There are certain functionality that is available in VB.NET that you might like to use from C# but can't. I remember I had to use J# to use some ZIP libraries that were not available in any other language in .NET.

6248,0,What you can do is trying this request with a different browser when the server is suppose to hang; and also try to do another request when the serveur is supposed to be hang to see if it's not a pb with the PDU length ( what I suspect is that when trying to decode this request; the decoder is waiting for more bytes so wait ad vitam aeternam ...) I gonna try to implement the decoding of this PDU as a test case just to check.
6249,0,[fiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/mcoomey/JPC4J/1/) was not related to the table layout of auto versus fixed. The fiddle shows that it works for both. If you are still seeing a problem while using the newer version of jQuery-ui; then it must be another issue with your code.

6296,1,Vishal Kher to Benjamin; Camille  9:38 AM (54 minutes ago) Hi Ben; I was going to open a jira after checking with you guys. With your solution won't we run in into the problem that Camille pointed out by marking the snapshot for lastZxid - 1? - Peer fails after taking the snapshot. The snapshot has applied lastZxid; which created a child znode. During recovery it will apply lastZxid; which will faill with NodeExists and we will increment the Cversion of the parent (after fix for ZOOKEEPER-1046). So creation of sequential znodes won't be be really sequential. This is probably acceptable; but should be clearly documented. If not; then from this bug; it looks to me that patch ZOOKEEPER-1046 was also not complete. We may need to conditionally update cversion.  I think we need a clear document of how snapshots are supposed to work and what to assume while taking snapshots and while recovering from snapshots. It will be very helpful for to verify the correctness of implementation and for future bug fixes.I will open a jira for this bug shortly and post our discussion as well. Thanks. -Vishal

6314,-1,We would prefer to keep this.  It is possible for the RILD and radio code to pass the sequence number through into radio state as the request is being acted on - the RILD may notice the socket error and re-establish the connection and then the response comes back from the radio with the old sequence number and get's passed back through the newly-connected RILD. Just because your implementation may not do this; we can imagine other OEMs passing back obsolete responses that would match a newly-zero'd RIL sequence number and confuse things. Couldn't you just remember the first sequence number your RILD connection received?  Then you know the number of requests you've received.

6339,0,Not really; you have to declare the functions somewhere visible to the caller. Header file is the most convenient way to do it; because it provides an interface. A possible approach is to merge those headers into one .h file; so you provide a single and complete interface with your library. The only other approach I can think about is declaring the functions in the files where you call them; but this is much more devastating and error prone then including a header file.

6389,-1,I am sorry to say this but most Silverlight grids do not support cell merging. At least not out of the box. I have resorted to using Component One studio for Silverlight in order to achieve this; and even then it hasn't been exactly a walk in the park. Consider C1 Data Grid control. Here is a sample on with sample code and a small write up. The down side of such solutions is that C1's controls are extremely expensive :( I wish Micro$oft came up with some enhancements in SL5 that would accommodate for such issues.

6417,0,"Not sure if the patch was pushed for review or not. In any case; fixing the build is pretty trivial; the changes made to ModificationStatement should just be reverted (and we should just pass the CL in argument to executeWithCondition() to SP.cas()). Other than that: * I believe we now refuse CL.SERIAL for the cas() method (because CL.blockfor() throw an UnsupportedOperationException for SERIAL). Maybe we can make SERIAL mean ""wait for nothing on commit; not even a local one"" (which probably amount to making CL.blockfor() return 0 for SERIAL and adding a 'if' in WriteResponseHandler ctor to signal right away if blockfor is 0). * I don't think CL.ANY will really work as for normal writes since we don't generate hints for commit. Maybe we could (generate hints) ultimately btw; but in the meantime; it might make more sense to refuse it (and thus make the default for CAS be either SERIAL if we do the preceding point or ONE). * We don't call CL.validateForWrite() when calling CAS (and we shouldn't as it complains with SERIAL); but maybe we should add a validateForConditionalWrite that would at least check we have the right replication strategy when using the multi-DC specific CLs."

6426,0,Some of your code seemed redundant; so I removed some. Such as defining and then duplicating it into so I just defined once. I got rid of ; ; and since you can just as easily enter the value directly.Then I got rid of the whole get the latest file in the log folder; and just added the content to the log file defined earlier. I changed the log entries so they were done by tabs so the entry type; date; and the actual entry all line up nicely when you view the log file.Lastly I changed the whole If>ElseIf>ElseIf thing into a Switch; because Switch is awesome and totally underused! Oh yeah; I got rid of because it's pointless to define a variable and then just echo it. What you could do is in the section have it write-host the error and call the log function again; so people are forced to enter a valid entry.

6451,1,I would love to do this. The problem is that all SSH information is only available inside of the SSH project and the server project which implements the REST endpoints doesn't have a dependency on it. Since we don't want this dependency I don't know how to implement it. On the other hand; if you have SSH enabled and you are interested in the SSH summary and connections you can retrieve this information via SSH. The REST endpoints are mainly important for installations where SSH is not available; but in this case there is also no SSH summary and no SSH connections. This is why I'm okay with the current solution of ignoring the SSH stuff in the REST endpoint.

6464,0,You can not return any thing.
6465,0,Not currently. It's somewhat different from what the current reference data approach uses; as I guess that you would want to generate that state using some code that is not part of the test (since if you can generate the state with code that runs anywhere; you do not really benefit from serialization). Generic serialization is also a significant amount of code; even if straightforward (and with C++; it requires some careful thinking on what kind of constraints it enforces on the serializable types; unless you make the object itself responsible for the serialization).

6494,0,OK The problem is that the o.a.f.bundlerepository doesn't cares about R3 or R4 bundles.
6495,1,Sky; it sounds like you can maintain *complete* test coverage for an exception. Excellent work! Maybe someday I'll learn how to do that.
6496,0,Given a handle of type HWND is it possible to confirm that the handle represents a real window?
6497,0,Filip is both correct and incorrect; at least wrt to Java and ASP.NET. An applet can get access to the ASP.NET session by cheating. In my case; we added the session id as a parameter to the applet; which the applet then adds as a cookie in it's requests. Seems to work ok. (We encrypted the session id to foil those nasty hacker folk!)
6498,0,Single page export is limitation of this library used to export PDFs and currently page size is simply increased to accommodate more data.
6499,1,You might want to look into JAXB. If you have a defined XML schema it will automatically create java classes that will easily allow you to 'marshal' (move data from java -> XML) and much much more. It's incredibly useful!

6501,1,I recently moved from a Mac + Textmate back to Visual Studio. The one thing I absolutely loved about textmate was it's find/search feature. It made navigating solution files so easy. Is there an equivalent shortcut/addon for Visual Studio?

6527,1,Great link! Thanks. I might use this document if we move over to C++ in our robots.
6528,0,We are using Python XMLRPCServer; which is baed on a base tcp server; creating a socket in its __init__. See /usr/lib64/python2.7/SocketServer.py line 413. We do not need this socket because we separated nicely the accept part from the request handling part. So our server should override __init__ to make sure we do not create a listening socket. Looking at the horrible Python code we are using ; I think this should be deferred to another patch; and the correct solution is not inheriting from XMLRPCServer; but instead write 20 lines server that take request from a queue and process them in a new thread. The way it is implemented here is fragile and impossible to understand with so many level of inheritance through so many modules (this; utils; SimpleXMLRCPServer; BaseHTTPServer; SocketServer).
6529,0,HadoopQA uses -p0 to apply patches.
6530,0,I'm afraid it can't be done; the psudo-class selectors can't be set in-line; you'll have to do it on the page or on a stylesheet. I should mention that technically you should be able to do it ; but most browsers don't support it Edit: I just did a quick test with this: And it doesn't work in IE7; IE8 beta 2; Firefox or Chrome. Can anyone else test in any other browsers?
6531,-1,After reading I was horrified! Isn't there a tool out there that can inspect a .h/.cpp file and deduce what dependencies could be waivered?
6532,0,Whether this is a terrible UI Experience or not depends upon the type of data collected. I once created an online job application system and most of the questions were long and quite detailed. In our testing; we found people often wanted to enter this in a random order and were quite frustrated when they couldn't. However; for a simpler checkout or registration process; particularly where steps depend on earlier steps then validation as you go is definitely preferred.
6533,-1,This whole thing is very distressing to me.

6537,1,Are there any tools to assist with the internationalization of Strings within JSP files? Most IDEs (for example; ) offer such a feature for Java code. However; in the case of NetBeans; no such feature exists for JSP files. With ; for example; there is are various tools out there that assist with extracting text Strings from code. Something similar for JSP would be great!

There are still a lot of things that has been not implemented or not working so contribution from other people are welcome.

I'm thinking to add a combo box after logged in to choose the posTerminalId but I didn't get the time to do it. Thanks Marco"
6541,0,Any feedback on the updated patch?  I'm guessing it won't cleanly apply to trunk anymore since it's been two weeks; but if the general idea looks correct; I can update it to apply cleanly to the current trunk.
6542,0,I've got a patch; figured I'd have someone take a quick look-see before pushing it to Apache.

6591,0,Verified by Oliver.
6592,-1,"Is this the right API? An alternative is: func If(s RuneSet; tTrue; tFalse Transformer) Transformer type RuneSet interface {   Contains(rune) bool } and have unicode.RangeTable implement this interface. If performance is a concern; the If function could do a type assertion to see if s is a *unicode.RangeTable; and switch to an optimized implementation; the same way that the image/draw package does in the stdlib. But I'm not sure if we even want a Ranges or If. The point of the Transformer interface is to transform things in bulk. If you're going to be chopping between two separate transformers depending on the input runes; then it seems like you're not getting the benefit of transforming in bulk. Instead; I'd just loop over the input and append to a []byte. It's not like you have some input that contains both Code Page 437 and Shift-JIS and you want to switch between them. Your phone number Ranges example seems a bit contrived; and again; I'd just for/range over the string for that particular task. As for title-casing latin but not greek; is that something that people really want to do?? I wonder what Rob thinks. Can you start a separate e-mail thread just for API design?"
6593,0,i have a cache that uses WeakReferences to the cached objects to make them automatically removed from the cache in case of memory pressure. My problem is that the cached objects are collected very soon after they have been stored in the cache. The cache runs in a 64-Bit application and in spite of the case that more than 4gig of memory are still available; all the cached objects are collected (they usually are stored in the G2-heap at that moment). There are no garbage collection induced manually as the process explorer shows. What methods can i apply to make the objects live a litte longer?
6594,0,Okay; then we will keep them in an engine stats request.

6596,1,It seems to be working really fine for me ; IE ; not tested but FF / Chrome it works !
6597,0,Firstly; that's not how works. You have to specify constants for each ; and those constants will be compared to the expression in parentheses (in your case; ). That is how works; period. Secondly; switch is not faster than several s And thirdly; you shouldn't really worry about miniscule performance optimizations when you're dealing with javascript.

6605,-1,My approach to this problem would be: Create a that hosts a Add a dependency property to the . In the event handler; parse the CSV and update the accordingly. Add a dependency property to the - and when this changes; parse the CSV and add the data to the . See this question for a few pointers: By the way; a CSV of column names is a horrible interface! Why not expose a ; then add a so that you can use a CSV string in XAML?

6611,0,bq. Actually; DIH started as a standalone webapp inside AOL. We changed it because we didn't want to duplicate the schema in two places and also because we wanted to have it available by default in Solr installations.  Another web app means you need to procure hardware; plan capacity/failover; create firewall holes etc Even if it were a standalone app; I would still run it on the same hardware that runs Solr; though I might run it on the secondary servers that aren't normally seeing query load. Why would you need to have the schema in two places?  My DIH config doesn't mention any field names; because all Solr field names match the MySQL field names.  Even if they didn't; I'm not sure why it would be any different than any other SolrJ client; which doesn't need to have a copy of the schema. bq. Talking to multiple collections was never a goal for DIH – I'm not sure what value it will bring. I've got a sharded index; currently production is on version 3.5.0.  Full rebuilds are done with DIH because my SolrJ application can't touch it for indexing speed.  It does fine for keeping the index up to date with once-a-minute updates; but for indexing millions of documents per shard; DIH beats it handily even though it's only single-threaded. If I could put all the DIH stuff into one central place; it might make it easier to manage.  I do intend to look at the DIH code to see how it manages to run so fast; so I can hopefully improve my own code; but I can never find the time.

6646,0,The three tests above that checks namespaces should probably grouped together. They seems to be copy pasted and just change which setting is gathered. You could uses a dataProvider too. That will build an array of tests cases and pass the case to a test method.  Anyway; you should extract the foreach / assert in a new internal method such as assertNamespaceIsValid()

6651,0,"I remember seeing error like ""Lproc: Attempting to register osc more than once"" when trying to mount lustre file system on server node. Looks like we have this logic to avoid re-creating osc proc entry in osp_mod_init but its counterpart is missing in osc_setup(). So if we have osp loaded before osc; we get the failure inserting osc module. The error now gets hidden with this patch because lprocfs_seq_register() only warns about it and creates duplicated entry in parent's subdir link. Then subsequent lookup only finds the newly created entry and it can cause random failures."

6682,0,It's unfortunate that there's a lot of code duplication; but it might be best that way.
6683,0,Thx for your investigations Chet.
6684,0,I see the outcome: A's do work whats the things you are expecting ?
6685,0,I solved this. That filter in web.xml must be first filter in file.
6686,0,S.Keller's solution worked for me and may fix your issue too.
6687,-1,ps really hate the response limits on comments.
6688,0,From the documentation at and ; I think this should work: Try that and see if it works. Otherwise; I'm afraid; it's preg_replace-land.
6689,0,I was surprised to see this issue still getting so much commentary.
6690,-1,The more I use UpdatePanels the more I hate them. I suggest you learn jQuery or another javascript library and avoid using UpdatePanels all together.
6691,0,I agree with Sami that this should be contributed to Tika and that we delegate the language identification handling in Nutch to Tika; just as we are doing or planning to for the MimeType and the parsing 
6692,1,Fantastic work! You were correct to choose yours as the accepted answer. Really appreciate you sharing the script with us. :)
6693,1,I just committed this. Thanks pat.
6694,1,+1 looks good - all tests pass.
6695,0,How do I create a table with fixed header and scrolling rows in struts 2?
6696,0,When the order of methods change; so the rendering of fragments is bellow the definition; then it works fine.
6697,0,Won't the guilty party simply increase the minimum amount that they'll try? I know they're trying to fly under the radar of the banks and on bank statements; but these days 10-20 is a more common amount to see on your statement than 2.35. Do you have specific experience with this?
6698,1,This provides the method CODE_FRAGMENT for inserting the element at specific location and it is very efficient.
6699,0,But; i didn't give me the thing i need!
6700,-1,clock() is not accurate enough.
6701,0,So there are a few possible causes to your woes and I'll state the likely quick fix first; and then state some best practices below that you should consider doing in the long term.
6702,0,"I'm just designing the schema for a database table which will hold details of email attachments - their size in bytes; filename and content-type (i.e. ""image/jpg""; ""audio/mp3""; etc). Does anybody know the maximum length that I can expect a content-type to be?"
6703,-1,I have spent days trying to find any information or working samples on how I can get google data such as emails in my gmail inbox; list of my contacts; my calendar events etc... None whatsoever :( There are broken pieces of some code fragments here and there; 90% say it's been deprecated; is the a one single page on the internet that gives me a working example how to do that from javascript. Many pages about oAuth; but I have absolutely no idea how to use it ; I have spent days reading broken pieces here and there; but I was unable to understand what that it and how I can use it PRACTICALLY. Very sad; and I am very tired to waste so much time on things that dont work and are not documented in human language; possible to understand. Why do they have to overcomplicate thing so much and spread broken pieces of information everywhere?
6704,0,You may close this issue.
6705,1,Thanks; Jeff!
6706,1,Ok; I finally figured out what I was looking for ( this link was also quite helpful ).
6707,0,Patch d1544-patch2-v2.diff committed revision 429036 - Thanks Deepa
6708,0,It would be great if you could work on it.
6709,0,"I think WordDelimiterFilter has special code that might avoid the problem (line 352) so it might be ok. Is there any better way we could solve this: for example maybe instead of the tokenizer calling correctOffset() it gets called somewhere else?"
6710,0,"Note I am a committer for Eclipse Collections."
6711,-1,"I did not suggest that the acquire/release functions would be called globally for all NI.  I said ""each time an interface that needs the acceptor"".  If the interface doesn't use the acceptor don't call acquire at startup; and don't call release at shutdown. I don't much care about the length of the list or the time involved.  I am looking for code that is more easy to read and maintain."
6712,0,Personally; just because you can doesn't mean you should.
6713,0,add a space after CMS so it read TYPO3 CMS 7 same for CMS8
6714,0,In few words; onchange event is not published until the checkbox lost focus.

6717,0,patch to add DynamicAttributesHandler and update SimpleTheme; AbstractCommonAttributesTest; and AbstractTest
6718,0,Fixed for exclusion: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1539249
6719,-1,can you help? i have a DB; the unique identifiers are GUIDS - we need to implement URL rewriting however the page names look terrible for example: testpage-2668FF87-0A3A-4cac-B9AB-2367D17A76C3.aspx title of page / unique identifier my DB's that i setup i use Ints as unique identifiers so i never had this problem: testpage-1.aspx title of page / unique identifier (int) what do you suggest ?
6720,0,A better; more common practice is to put in the combo box only the items that can be selected. It won't prevent keyboard usage (I; as a user; would find this offensive!) and simplify code.
6721,-1,@Luke; Sorry for the late; attaching latest version patch
6722,0,"Thanks for clarification; so we're hitting the ""validation logic first marks the model as valid even if it might not be; then runs validators on given model"" thing again; and we need to deal with it."

6733,-1,that _is_ sad news
6734,0,Hi Jacopo; no problem.
6735,1,Carl Lindberg; absolutely you are right. I was not far-sighted enough to think of that. Thank you about your point.^^ My one is not a good idea. I will try to fix it. (T.T). Thanks again. 
6736,1,This looks good to me. +1 pending beta-8.
6737,1,Hey very cool. 
6738,0,Is Flex Data Services the proprietary version of BlazeDS?
6739,-1,I have issues with Aptana (3.6.0.201...658) on dark themes. Every time I hit the cursor; the horizontal scroll bar in the workspace flickers into view and out again. This seems to be a bug; which has been reported already a long time ago: Has anyone else found a solution? Makes working in Aptana incredibly annoying.
6740,0,Jason; thanks for the patch.
6741,0,Check if your Table has that style bit.
6742,-1,bad define. This is the .h file. Please run KWStyle.
6743,-1,I don't see this as needing more prominence here; so much as the increase in docs is *an entire second proposal* wedged into this one. I'd vote for merging as is; and making the docs process a standalone follow-up.
6744,0,They should be unique!
6745,0,"I don't know how this is guaranteed if i/j/k is constant. For example; on both arm/386; cgen_slice is called with: cgen_slice-n [0x4208194b40] .   SLICE u(1) l(9) tc(1) ARRAY-[]int .   .

6749,0,The search result entry requests does not return the correct DN; because it use the internal representation (byte[]) instead of using the user provided value; which contains escaped values.
6750,-1,I don't want to do anything fancy on Twitter except post to it via my site once a day. I have searched around a bit and there are all sorts of super-complex ways to do every little thing that Twitter does; but there seems to be little documentation on how to do the simplest thing; which is make a post! Does anyone know how to do this? Or can you at least point me in the right direction? I don't need full wrappers or anything (); just one simple function that will post to Twitter. Thanks!
6751,1,great answer - this code works like a charm on Mac OSX! :-) doing a few settings up front removes code duplication when accessing settings from many places; see http://developer.qt.nokia.com/doc/qt-4.8/qsettings.html#basic-usage
6752,0,On startup; I agree that we can skip cache reports until the cache is populated.
6753,0,I'll focus my efforts on the compile targets then.
6754,-1,For C# Visual Studio uses 4 spaces by default; whereas for C++ it is hard-tabs. Why is it so? Why is it different? My project consists of both C# and C++ code and the difference really annoys me. I want to set a common standard for all the sources; but I wonder if this would have any drawbacks.
6755,1,Wow; wow; wow! I actually found a better way to do that... if I keep the same abbreviation and change template text into: it does want I wanted; but in the way cooler way! So you can use your own variables in a template as long as you don't call them or Awesome!
6756,0,Bikas -is there any reason to not make the {{close()}} operation in {{unpackEntries()}} part of the try/finally logic? Other than that it looks good to be -the {{Shell.WINDOWS}} checks ensure that the Unix untars will be the existing shell commands and not break anything

6761,0,Obtain the raw lines and keep them in a ( Clojure ) lazy sequence.
6762,0,It's true that such an example would crash; but then it's not QRE responsability -- the user destroyed the QString holding the data. It is reasonable to argue  that the match object would still be using the stringref passed in input (as it has been told to work on that); which is now invalid because of an user's action. OTOH; unless we want to change the current behaviour; I can't argue the same with the QString overload...

6767,0,Yes.  Actually; look at what I just merged to master with the query operators; in particular you might want to read the documentation in user-search.txt.  You can write a query to identify changes that can be submitted: is:open CodeReview+2 Verified+1 -Verified-1 -CodeReview-2 If we put that string (minus the is:open part that would be implied) into your field; it means what you want it to mean... you can submit this only if the above expression is true. By making it a single string; all you need to do is feed the string from the table through the ChangeQueryBuilder to get a Predicate<ChangeData>; and then run match() on that to see if the submit is possible.  That completely removes the FunctionState mess and starts to move us into this configurable submit logic that we have been discussing for quite a long time. So the existence of that ChangeQueryBuilder and its Predicate support classes is why I was trying to steer you into a simple string here.  We have the code already done to handle that as a string; and users can use the same syntax to search for changes as they can for controlling how we manage them.
6768,1,Thank you; Carol!
6769,1,Applied to master and branch 1.2.x. Thanks Klaus.
6770,0,Also; if you are worried about trips to the db; make steps into a stored procedure. Then you have one trip.

6775,0,hudson was hung just now for 7 hours in TestHRegion.  TestHRegion is unorthodox -- intentionally -- in that it doesn't use inherit from HBaseClusterTestCase so it didn't pick up the changes made w/ mhbc.patch.  Hopefully its this anomaly that was responsible for the hang.  Attaching a patch that has TestHRegion do like the rest of the hbase (and hadoop dfs) tests shutting down the filesystem first and then the dfs cluster.
6776,1,@TonyThinkk No worries!!

6786,-1,I've searched this and cannot find it. I've tried different plugins and different browsers (Firefox; Opera; and Chrome). I've tried most of the no flash plugins for each of those as well as disabling Flash plugins/addons in the settings. I also renamed the file in i found by searching the system. when i renamed it; makes Firefox and Chrome ask to install Flash; but still: returns: I'm not sure what else to try without uninstalling Flash; but that will be a total pain in the ass for this. I also REALLY don't want to use SWFObject just to see if Flash is at all installed which I can do simply with: Any ideas?

6791,0,Please check that the patch was applied as you expected.
6792,0,The fix causes test to fail in other circumstances.  Apparently File.delete() can't be relied upon to actually delete the file.
6793,0,OK You are correct about that.
6794,-1,Android apps are constrained to a certain amount of memory. As it's quite (insanely?) low; I think you shouldn't feel guilty about using all of it! The limit is 16 MB on very old devices; 24 MB or 32 MB on newer ones. There doesn't seem to be much info on the size for different devices; and nobody seems to know why the limit is so small when modern phones have 1-2 GB of RAM. Aha; I found some concrete numbers on the limit: G1: 16MB Droid: 24MB Nexus One: 32MB Xoom: 48MB
6795,0,can i just use my and meta tags in Ruby or is there an easy way to do it?
6796,0,and XPath... XQuery is more what you are looking for if a SQL structure is desirable.
6797,-1,I misread.
6798,-1,So for example if I need to run Git Pull in the commandline; I need to specify the full path to everything...? That's really annoying.
6799,1,I'll look into the namespace handler. Thanks. Yes; I should have added the different event handling support to the TODO above. I need to think more about this and look into the camel code a bit more. Using just the endpoint api; I couldn't create routes on the fly; hence the polling consumer approach. I'll keep hacking away at in in my toolbox when customer needs dictate. Am I missing something in your approach; how would I do this then in the XML DSL using your approach? I think virtual routing is a known limitation of Camel when you start to deploy large scale systems. Out of curiosity have you seen camel ever been deployed with 1000's of routes (and/or routes files)? I think this would have FD and thread overkill problems. Everything repeats itself :)
6800,0,Is it confirmed with UI team to use this distinction?
6801,1,Note: There were no errors in the console and the CODE_FRAGMENT function was working perfectly.

6803,-1,Setting the property of your picker controller to should remove the focus square (it did pre 4.3; I don't think anything has changed); but the downside is you'll need to provide your own controls (to take photos; etc). It's all or nothing I'm afraid!
6804,0,Could we remove the setProperty() implementation in HierarchicalConfiguration and use the default implementation in AbstractConfiguration ?
6805,-1,The really sad thing is I could do this in about 5 lines of Ada code...
6806,0,Or did you introduce these concepts?
6807,0,Try using equalsIgnoreCase instead of straight CODE_FRAGMENT.
6808,0,Then assign value.
6809,0,I lost my MySQL username and password. How do I retrieve it?
6810,1,Regarding WCF/FTP/WS-Attachment/DIME: Excellent suggestions and some interesting reading. These are probably the types of long term solutions that I will end up using. However if there was some short term solution for changing the upload size in IIS7 that would be excellent. Thanks.
6811,-1,From my experiences so far; I've concluded that the HTML5 Manifest scheme was really terribly designed. My site serves a manifest file when a user is logged in. Unfortunately; when they log out; they can still access the cached protected materials. Can anyone think of a way to fix this?
6812,0,I'd prefer if sizeof(x) was used throughout; instead of sizeof(op_t). As a bonus; op_t would only occur once (in the variable declaration) and then the typedef could easily be removed.
6813,-1,ewwww. Longer term; why are we not just using monotonic timers on x86? Still; this is known good; we can take it as an action item; as there might be a reason.
6814,-1,This sucks *so much*...
6815,0,Didn't see the selector the first time round.
6816,1,I just committed this. Thanks Mahadev!
6817,1,I swear I read somewhere on Smashing magazine along time ago that all pseudo selectors are less performant but I can't find such an article. I can only find these 2 references (not sure of there credibility): * http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4082077/first-child-is-too-slow-alternatives/4082105#4082105 * http://www.onextrapixel.com/2012/05/03/css-tricks-how-to-speed-up-css-rendering/ I think the main thing I would say is whilst integrating with VE we should avoid them where possible. Use of first-child might invite us to use last-child and other selectors based on the idea. I do think we should be avoid nth-of-type and nth-child at all costs but I'd expect first-child and last-child to be less evil! That said browsers are getting better and better these days and we could just make the decision that we will use them and wait for browsers and VE to catch up. As tech lead; let me know what approach you want us to take. Happy either way. Please can we get the outcome documented on the coding guidelines page?

Think SharePoint Content Types... but on steroids. Oslo steroids - Possible or not?

6875,0,There is another angle to this.
6876,1,Thanks for the finding; Andrey. createDir() is recursive. Would be nice to write it in iterative manner. Would FileSystem.mkdirs() do the job ?
6877,0,Marcus; that sounds sensible.
6878,0,The `API_NAME 'property represents an estimate of the number of words in the Word document.
6879,0,Yup because I am doing a search; unless you know another way.
6880,-1,The function is extremely annoying because it uses a prototype or something insane like that. You'd have to do an ampersand-call to override the prototype: .However; you are trying to transpose the matrix; not to it (which would produce a continuous list like We could use an iterator in conjunction with : which works; but this is severely overthinking the problem. Let's just swap indices:

6884,1,That would be great! @Heinz: contact established :-)
6885,1,@Evan It's not compilable java. It's used to navigate the code in eclipse/idea and is excellent if you have a large code base with lots of long class names.
6886,-1,Off topic; but I really really hate the 5 ` `s in a row. That's abuse!

6896,0,FWIW:After the first Mod; a >= 0. b is already > 0 by definition. So the rest of this code is all done using natural numbers and thus could probably be (slightly) more efficient by using nat's directly. Perhaps next CL.

6898,1,I have FILE_NAME that allows to download a file from the internet.
6899,0,Brian - We're not storing the user_token in the cache; we store the data after decrypting and JSON-decoding. If clients were passing in token hashes only we wouldn't know that it was originally PKI.

6901,-1,Damn; I would close this out from the fix to JBSEAM-3742; except the quartz and seampay examples use a custom XML namespace and the XML schema validator is not happy with that.

6909,0,So what do you think?
6910,-1,This isn't C. Stop comparing it with C. What you are doing here with the brightness is just redefining the same thing. Both boards you touched have the same definitions for the brightness; \DSPC.BRTU and \DSPC.BRTD; so it makes limited sense to redefine them as something interim.

6918,1,Here's a set of solutions to this challenge for both JDK types and Eclipse Collections types using CODE_FRAGMENT.
6919,1,To convert raster images to vectorial images; I found (free) to do an excellent job (comparable to VectorMagic; which is not free anymore by the way). In Inkscape; import your image and use the Path/Trace Bitmap function. It has a lot of control. Once you converted to a vectorial image; save it as a SVG. Then; using ; you can convert to XAML vector data. (Path & Canvas)

6953,0,See other comment about OUString together with ScResId. Just as short explanation: The current code creates a SchResId object which has an operator OUString which is called here. Then the OUString copy c'tor is called to generate a copy from the returned OUString.

6955,0,Add CRC32C as another DataChecksum implementation.
6956,0,I saw this recently when using a custom built ActiveMQ (5.0.0.9-fuse) with ServiceMix (3.2.1).
6957,0,The point of the require_once function is that no matter the scope; you won't include a file twice and redefine a class causing a PHP error. So no worries about memory leaks; if the require_once is hit; the class def goes in the global symbol table only one time. But aside from that; yeah use autoloader.
6958,0,Patch with the fixes.
6959,0,These should *not* be 30 days. The default in mediawiki-core is 5 minutes and we use that in wmf-production as well; including all users and for large wikis.

6974,1,Thanks a lot for fixing those issues; Alejandro. I re-ran all the tests I ran last night and everything worked great. Additionally; I tried out test-patch.sh; which seemed to work flawlessly. +1; patch looks good to me.
6975,0,@JonSkeet Boy you really hated my edit.
6976,0,These are wrapper functions; and will use in test cases directly.
6977,1,I have a table with a field that needs to store 512 characters. My question is this: can you limit the length of a TEXT field (VARCHAR stops at 255 - I can't use it) to 512 characters? If I do that; will MySQL run through the table quicker due to the fixed data length; or does it act a bit like VARCHAR in that the length can vary? I don't have a table (at all) yet; but I'm very conscious about speed and size for the future. I found this article: incredibly useful - maybe you will to! Thanks a lot; James

6983,0,If you want to be really paranoid; you can install VPN clients on every computer; and have a off-site VPN server at a datacenter... But that eats into your bandwidth; and is probably more complexity than you want to put up with.

6990,0,Currently; I have a method.
6991,-1,Sorry; I was not able to create one diff-file; so I added for every build.xml an own diff.

6994,-1,Stefan; I'm just mostly replicating the what is done when including CSS styled content's TS using the include static select. To me your questions show you did not look at the issue. Can we please get this through? Apart from the above; no there is not a filename; and yes there needs to be a slash.

7003,0,Nevermind.  I believe someone has already addressed it in CAMEL-4294.  I have linked the issue here.
7004,0,There is an excellent example of how to implement your own two-dimensional ArrayList and (re-) use it in your specific case: No need to reinvent the wheel; go for it!
7005,0,Changed to check ahead and simply log the fact that we will not overwrite files.
7006,0,Not sure where these param are from args or kwargs? Suggest to doc them clearly:         :param args: ...         :param kwargs:  A dict of keyword arguments to be passed to the method;                        which should contain: â€˜usernameâ€™; â€˜passwordâ€™; â€˜auth_urlâ€™; â€˜api_versionâ€™ parameters.
7007,1,Good idea especially if you have a use case for that.
7008,-1,I am using Internet Explorer 11. Something annoying keeps happening when I add code to my site through the CMS form that I use. Take this line: Let's say I want to copy just this in IE; through the form on the page: When I go to copy just that section; it actually copies this: It is VERY annoying! It doesn't happen on Chrome or Firefox. For reasons with the CMS I have to use Internet Explorer. Is there a setting I can change so that doesn't happen? On Windows 7 if that helps. Sorry if this doesn't 100% fit with programming; someone let me know if there is a better place for this question.

7023,-1,Not even sure what JSR that is.

7030,1,Thanks  Rishi Solanki  to review the patch.
7031,1,Thanks once again.

7038,0,Right; I would assume the problem occurs when the user doesn't intend to sync to a fixed version. However; if that's the case; I'm not sure just switching this to only happen with current-branch-only will be enough. We at least should update the docs for --current-branch to make it clear that it will have this behavior and that if all objects are desired; they should run sync without -c (either for all projects or just a specific project).

7053,0,hmm; I'm concerned about the lock contention in this function. As multiple threads will likely invoke this function; this can affect the CRUD performance. Can we simply use an atomic variable for each latency stat?
7054,-1,This just feels wrong. The test setup code should not be writing to the notedb separately; there should be a method in PatchLineCommentsUtil that writes to the appropriate storage(s) based on the config.

7065,0,performTransaltion has different purpose. If scale is less than equal to 1 we will not perform transaltion. If the device doesn't support multi touch we need not go into this block and skip the execution of the next six lines; hence it was added here.

7081,1,Thanks; that's great additional info Sam!
7082,0,It is a little weird since the multi-core aspect would only be usable programatically; but that will make it possible to easily bat around a 'core manager' and http design.
7083,0,I think we should log the name of the fwaas driver that we loaded here. Helps to debug.

7085,0,Mike; I can take this one if you want...
7086,-1,It also happens at the very startup after he has loaded only 3 sstables (hence DataTracker likely have 3 sstables; not a shit load).

7091,0,This code is 99% correct. However; if we call Peek or Pop without putting anything on the stack; it will crash as the index is -1. This could be easily fixed by adding index bounds checking.

7094,0,Why not Double.TryParse ?
7095,0,Noah said he’s going to fix this in his build-fauxton branch; but I’d like to explain this for posterity. make indeed throws this error; I didn’t suggest it is a grunt.js error; but it’s the way we use Autotools. In particular; in how we use Autotools for packaging. Each file that is supposed to end up in our final apache-couchdb-x.y.z.tar.gz tarball needs to be marked as such in a Makefile.am. For Fauxton that means we maintain a list of Fauxton files in src/Makefila.am specified as `FAUXTON_FILES`: FAUXTON_FILES = \     fauxton/app/addons/activetasks/assets/less/activetasks.less \     fauxton/app/addons/activetasks/base.js \     fauxton/app/addons/activetasks/resources.js \     …and so on In that list; there is a line: `fauxton/app/initialize.js`; e.g. where we say that file is supposed to go into the release tarball. That file however does not exist at the time `make dist` is run; so make complains. I assume the solution is that make needs to call grunt at some point to turn fauxton/app/initialize.underscore into fauxton/app/initialize.js and I think that is what Noah is doing in his branch. I just wanted to explain; why this isn’t a make error. 
7096,1,Ho yes; perhaps I should change the commit message ? It's because the policy was set to NEW; so it will do nothing anyway; as we are already using cmake > 2.6.0
7097,0,It'd work but it's a halfway hack to the real fix we should do in 0.92. My points is that I think it is a good idea in general to raise this timeout (while adding configs so you don't necessarily have to wait since smallish clusters could use the max param if they want to speed this up)... we have run into the situation where not all RS came in the 3 second window (which really is too small given heartbeat frequency) so I've already ramped up the config timeout for fb production. But I'm fine implementing the halfway fix if my argument still doesn't win you over :)
7098,-1,I am planning to use this framework for some new RPCs I am adding.

7101,1,Excellent point! Thanks!! I did mean just the left side though.. (I should have specified that). Was glad to learn your insight though..
7102,1,this is a really great idea!!! please standby while i try thank u so much
7103,0,"It took me a while to figure out where the problem is coming from; sorry.  So; your way is not a bad way of doing it; though; let me suggest an alternative... In AbstractFileObject; match the constructor's ""fs.fileObjectHanded(this);"" by putting a ""fs.fileObjectDestroyed(this)"" in  ""abstract's doDetach().""  This way; the count will be corrected.  Currently; it's appears to be wrong in many implementations.  In the overriding implementation of detach(); do a check of (if fs.isReleasable(); fs.close()).  Patches included."

7111,0,ok; but then i suggest you turn that thing into a macro which you can document centrally (QT_SEGMENTED_STRING_LITERAL or so). also; a warning in the QStringLiteral doc would be in order if it's not there yet.

7126,-1,I'm doing one app which requires AJAX call on almost every user interaction possible; I started writing JS functions; webservices etc. to handle all of that(still long way to go from here). Now I am wondering If I made a mistake maybe I should put whole page in update panel because I really hate writting JS. Is there some drawback to use it instead of custom written ajax calls to web service and js functions; and is it better to use more update panels or one big?

7146,0,These are all svn file deletions which will need to be done by hand when applying the hand.
7147,0,I haven't spent enough time thinking about this but I think it is more than just fixing the error message string. It seems that the comparable method in DTD should return int rather than boolean and the return int value will decide if we should throw what we are throwing today (ie something like ERROR 42818: Comparisons between 'VARCHAR' and 'CHAR' are not supported. ) or throw a new message because collations don't match. This is just my initial thought; haven't spend enough time to think about a solution
7148,-1,I don't line inline styles; can this be done in CSS?
7149,-1,I just updated my MacVim to 7.3 and with it; it now changes directories to whatever file I'm currently editing. I use PeepOpen; so it's incredibly annoying to cd back to my project directory every time I want to edit a new file.

Not sure about whether it is stable yet. {quote} I'd tend to lean towards making it Stable to ensure it's never broken; it probably deserves that status given how central it is to the framework. Thoughts? I don't see either 'audience' for this yet it the patch; maybe you missed it? bq. Are MarkableIterator and MarkableIteratorInterface public user classes? The unit test for them (TestValueIterReset) implies that the user instantiates a MarkableIterator. +1; public bq.

7186,0,I need to send and receive data over serial connections (RS-232 and RS-422). How do I set up and communicate with such a connection? How do I figure out what the configuration settings (e.g. baud rate) should be and how do I set them? In particular I am looking to do this in Java; C/C++; or one of the major Unix shells but I also have some interest in serial programming using Windows/Hyperterminal.
7187,-1,I do not understand... I am not trying to fix the world now... all I need is to ask vdsm what is its id without having to deal with handling the /etc/vdsm/vdsm.id are the above valid to this task? the new code of vdsm-reg will call vdsm-tool vdsm-id --force and get id no matter if it is uuid or generated from anywhere else; this id is required for registration. if you then want to improve how it is 'generated' you are welcome to do so; it will not break the interface.

7203,-1,no; it is not possible -- we tried hard and ended up reverting to the 10.7 way of using a custom class.. check MAAttachedWindow well with enough swizzling and posing it'd be possible of course... but that is very evil and at least as much work as your own class!
7204,-1,My guess would be from a colleague who wanted to scare this person out of ever using 'this' again. It can be fairly annoying when someone uses 'this' for every single thing they do. Not that it justifies lying to a new programmer; but I can imagine someone doing this out of frustration.

7244,1,Version 2 of contains a debugger. And it works awesome! It is still in very early stages; but have helped me several times. Just watch out for bugs! :)
7245,0,you can create webservice and deploy it over IIS and consume it from j2me app /.
7246,0,I've been having a spam problem on my site; where people sign up and act extremely abusive to other users of my site. I can easy IP ban them; except they always come back under a different IP address through a proxy or TOR. So I was curious if there are any php classes or functions that can look up the IP and determine if its a genuine user; or someone behind a proxy; in which case it would muzzle their accounts upon registration.
7247,-1,Ran into this myself. Very annoying limitation IMO.
7248,1,You're results are awesome Paul. Great work :) Looking forward to see your new JSON parser in trunk whenever you think is ready.
7249,0,Instead of saying: say: This would preserve the tag and also remove the malicious code from lines where the tag doesn't exist! EDIT: As by ; you can say:
7250,-1,Another thing I hate to see is the : I've seen this in real code.
7251,0,Didn't make 1.1
7252,0,I will rewrite that part.
7253,0,I created the simplest possible android app which starts the RegisterActivity generated by the plugin; where I did plug the ID; Api Key and project number.
7254,0,Thank you Ole!
7255,1,Jean-Marc; can you review it? Thanks.
7256,0,Will take a look after we decide how to move forward.
7257,-1,Same question: Do you want me to declare the RevTree variables before?
7258,0,Dupe of CASSANDRA-4042 (we'll include the BF fp change there)
7259,-1,That link is full of horrible advice.
7260,1,"So I'm using activerecord to get the count of items for a certain day: But this doesn't give me if there are no records for a given day; how can I fix this? Or is there are more ""Rails"" way do to something like this? Any help is hugely appreciated; thanks again!"
7261,0,Try to add the complete failed message in the question!
7262,1,Applied patch with thanks to Scott.
7263,-1,[~sershe] sorry for late reply. I upload the patch to https://reviews.facebook.net/D13341. Could you help to review it ? thx.
7264,1,Thats sweet that you have the prior experience hacking this on top of a store already.
7265,-1,Horrible but linqy!
7266,-1,I have a datagridview and need of context menu. When i right-click on cell (RED POINT) - context menu shows.. But in wrong place. Can't understand why here is the code: That stuff really annoys me!
7267,1,I just committed this. Thanks; Omer!
7268,0,Thanks!
7269,0,We're looking at Drools/Guvnor; possibly integrated with jBPM (as in this ); to add a workflow engine to our Spring/Java EE app; but we're still in the very early phases of trying it out.
7270,1,We are currently using PDE to automatically build features and our complete product. It works quite well. Make sure you use the right script for product build or feature build. EDIT: We've now migrated to ; which has an excellent command line interface.
7271,1,I like this title.
7272,1,+1 Patch looks good
7273,0,What about CODE_FRAGMENT and calling CODE_FRAGMENT on the returned CODE_FRAGMENT.
7274,0,It is Dependency Injection (DI) - see Martin Fowlers' descrition here: http://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html#InversionOfControl
7275,0,"Add: When you copy a manifest object; the new object is a ""normal"" object -- not a copy of the manifest. Instead it is a concatenation of all the segment objects. This means that you cannot copy objects larger than 5GB in size. All metadata is preserved during the object copy. If you specify metadata on the request to copy the object (either the PUT or the COPY); the metadata overwrites any conflicting keys on the target (new) object."
7276,-1,Sorry; that should be FileChannel inputChannel = input.getChannel(); FileChannel outputChannel = output.getChannel(); in the try block.
7277,1,Thanks for applying the images. Please check and apply the patch I've submitted to FOR-1008 [1]. Since the changes required to resolve this issue involves files modified there; it has to be applied first. [1] https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12363540/valid_xdoc.patch
7278,0,I'd just keep creating my own dependency properties; personally. It really isn't much extra work; and then you don't have to worry about any of the possible caveats.
7279,0,I think the rename should follow the same pattern.
7280,0,">OTOH we might grep in ""$@"" for ""project:"" and only add project:core if none was given. but then we could do the same with branch and status: default branch = master; default status = open => logerrit query would be translated to core/master/open. How about it?"
7281,1,i found some class that a very great men develop!!! that solove this: here is a link to download it it the last post on the page: direct link:
7282,0,And the .irbrc sample output has no line breaks and makes it difficult to read it.
7283,0,This is a question just to satisfy my curiosity.
7284,0,Having How to convert a to a ?
7285,0,If you can change the code it helps to use CODE_FRAGMENT ( with no host parameter or with a connected socket ).
7286,0,In a similar manner; you can populate the request scope ( ideally done in a filter ) using.
7287,0,Please not that in the above code CODE_FRAGMENT method will close not only the CODE_FRAGMENT object itself but also its underlining stream ( i.e. keyboard input ).
7288,0,this will cause the MKFSOPT to skip --mkfsoptions string if MKFSOPT is empty and MDSJOURNAL_SIZE=xxx
7289,0,Done. Note the modified tests. I don't think it matters that they fail differently now. It's probably better; actually.
7290,0,I think that the problems are not related.
7291,0,As per the Java doc.
7292,-1,Not sure I want the transient inability to clean up some local log or other trivial task to kill a whole pig job?
7293,0,I see some mention of ``flavours ''on the net but seems all the hits are to do with Android development and properties.
7294,-1,That's very sad :(
7295,0,How should integer division work for decimals and floating point?
7296,-1,When I slide to a next image; or when the slider/carousel automatically switches to the next image the previous image disapears too fast; which gives it an extremely ugly look. I've made a video to make clear what I mean; can be checked over here. Anyone has an idea? Code for the carousel:
7297,0,There is no mxmlc.exe in the 4.10 release only mxml (for OSX and Linux) and mxml.bat (for windows). How did you install 4.10?
7298,0,Please review.
7299,1,@ecu - Excellent :) I added an answer so future googlers can find the answer a bit easier; it seems comments aren't looked at nearly as often when scanning for the reason.
7300,0,Methods that are not 'const' will most likely change the state of the object. That is exactly the reasoning behind object orientation : you call operations that do stuff; and you don't have to worry about the object's internal state.
7301,-1,Well it's me that didn't get the whole point; now i got more; sorry for the noise.
7302,0,@sll: Not True... See my Edit
7303,1,Excellent answer to a very general question ! :-)
7304,-1,"For what it's worth; NSCollectionView does this too (you can see it in action in the IconCollection sample code). They apparently wait for a ""quiet period"" in which you've stopped dragging. I've been trying to write a similar class; and it is definitely a pain to get the animations to run consistently and properly during the resize."
7305,-1,@talnicolas I'm using it a few dozen times in my class. It's heavy to write; not easy to read and very painful to debug. I'm sorry; I didn't think the question was that subjective; maybe someone should move it to PROGRAMMERS!?
7306,-1,I can't believe one of those Regex haters hasn't posted a comment about how parsing HTML with Regex contributes to the rise of Cthulhu!
7307,0,The reason I do not want to have method to accept Reader is that; I want my own method to have own control to decide what type of encoding should be used.
7308,0,"Hi Tommaso; bq. However I think it should be good if it was possible to alternatively get rid of the uimaConfig file defining each parameter inside the Processor with Solr elements (str/lst/int etc.) as well. I've done this in the attached patch. Please review it. I'm not confident about the part: {code}<lst name=""fieldMappings"">   <lst name=""mapping"">     <str name=""type"">org.apache.uima.SentenceAnnotation</str>     <str name=""feature"">coveredText</str>     <str name=""field"">sentence</str>   </lst> </lst> {code} the structure is appropriate or not."
7309,0,Alexey; please verify.
7310,1,Excellent! PHP really is an impressive language.
7311,1,thnx man; it works really good; awesome stuff !!!
7312,1,Patches are welcome! 
7313,-1,I'm not sure we would ever remove this. When running the Super Dev Mode from a static html page instead of a server; people link directly to .nocache.js; so it should always exist.
7314,0,You can try and do nothing about it.
7315,0,Definitely true!
7316,-1,Yes; you should implement pagination before that; at the SQL query stage. Otherwise there's nothing better than iterating and discarding (which is really horrible).
7317,-1,From the dev list; didn't want to lose this background (or make Uwe type it again <G>) The idea was to maybe replace RAMDirectory by a “clone” of MMapDirectory that uses large DirectByteBuffers outside the JVM heap. The current RAMDirectory is very limited (buffersize hardcoded to 8 KB; if you have a 50 Gigabyte Index in this RAMDirectory; your GC simply drives crazy – we investigated this several times for customers. RAMDirectory was in fact several times slower than a simple disk-based MMapDir). Also the locking on the RAMFile class is horrible; as for large indexes you have to change buffer several times when seeking/reading/…; which does heavily locking. In contrast; MMapDir is completely lock-free! Until there is no replacement we will not remove it; but the current RAMDirectory is not useable for large indexes. That’s a limitation and the design of this class does not support anything else. It’s currently unfixable and instead of putting work into fixing it; the time should be spent in working on a new ByteBuffer-based RAMDir with larger blocs/blocs that merge or IOContext helping to calculate the file size before writing it (e.g. when triggering a merge you know the approximate size of the file before; so you can allocate a buffer that’s better than 8 Kilobytes). Also directByteBuffer helps to make GC happy; as the RAMdir is outside JVM heap..... RAMdir uses more time for switching buffers than reading the data. The problem is that MMapDir does not support *writing* and that why we plan to improve this. Have you tried MMapDir for read access in comparison to RAMDirectory for a larger index; it outperforms several times (depending on OS and if file data is in FS cache already). The new directory will simply mimic the MMapIndexInput; add MMapIndexOutput; but not based on a mmapped buffer; instead a in-memory (Direct)ByteBuffer (outside or inside JVM heap – both will be supported). This simplifies code a lot. The discussions about the limitations of crappy RAMDirectory were discussed on conferences; sorry. We did *not*decide to remove it (without a patch/replacement). The whole “message” on the issue was that RAMDirectory is a bad idea. The recommended approach at the moment to handle large in-ram directories would be to use a tmpfs on Linux/Solaris and use MMapDir on top (for larger indexes). The MMap would then directly map the RAM of the underlying tmpfs.....
7318,0,You might have both JPA NUMBER and JPA NUMBER persistence jars on the classpath.
7319,-1,BTW: This is one reason why I hate this autoboxing shit since Java 5. I would love to have a way to prevent it in code (forbidden checks should detect this somehow).
7320,0,{{TrivariateRealFunction}} renamed in r1236932.
7321,1,Committed; thanks
7322,0,TRUNCATE_ONLY option on log backup is discontinued in SQL 2008.
7323,1,Yeah; I used that in other places. You're right it doesn't make much of a difference: no difference for norm and about 20% or 20k for the language tables. I've simplified the code and also now use NewFormattedFileWriter in all the other places where I'm used go/format before. See the diff of language/table.go to see how it is affected (will first do the IANA update separately).Unfortunately; this increases the diff a lot. Again in language/tables.go. But you can verify the data itself didn't change by looking at the checksum at the bottom.
7324,0,How about a slightly different take?
7325,0,Is it possible to configure nHibernate to connect to Paradox database (*.db files)?
7326,1,See also this excellent answer: http://unix.stackexchange.com/a/90869/92102
7327,0,"don't hard code ""char"". Make a typedef for it (IdType maybe?)  and use int8_t in the declaration"
7328,0,Yes I'm building MINA myself from trunk. Just to be sure; when I checkout the code from <http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/mina/trunk> I'll get always the latest code!? I'll see if I can some up with a little application (it may take a few days due to a lot of work I've to finish). -Roger

7331,0,The renderer is selected based on the component family and renderer type by CODE_FRAGMENT.
7332,-1,What the hell; I'll give this a shot.
7333,0,Because we don't need anything that it provides (checking that the value is not None and encoding it) so there's not much point pulling it out of the loop below. Actually; we would have to leave it in the loop below as well since it uses the `env' outer variable.
7334,1,The patches look good :)
7335,0,Sorry that this patch seems to have slipped through the cracks.
7336,-1,So it's basically in the wrong form.
7337,1,Omar Al Zabir has an excellent post on using cache item callbacks for this purpose.
7338,0,While this is excellent advice; as other answers state; there is a more nuanced answer in the case of an immutable; safely published map instance. But you should do that only if You Know What You're Doing.
7339,-1,Is there a way to run a specific Ant task via the keyboard? I have a rsync to dev task that I run a lot and running to the mouse to double-click is a pain.
7340,1,Jaigak - Its nice to see another application on top of Yarn.  Since its a lot of new code; could you please add some notes on the high level components and suggest some pointers on navigating the code. It will help review the changes. Thanks!
7341,1,@PaulMougel;Thanks Super Great! it works! I added it (res.end()) habitually and have never thought it might could be the reason. Happy New Year. Thank again you so much.

7344,0,How do we make sure we are matching the right hostnames?
7345,0,"Hi. Yes; perhaps I got a bit trigger happy. Although I did get a +1 from another committer and I assumed that the ""submit patch to hudson"" wouldn't be able to pick up on the renaming of the test using patch.sh and would fail. Perhaps there is a better way to do this which I am not aware of? Glad to get feedback though; need to properly get the hang of the process"

7353,-1,Perhaps I am missing something; but I am just learning javascript. My understanding of Single Origin Policy is that Google Analytics should not be able to send data back to Google. How is it able to transmit send data to Google without violating the policy?
7354,0,[error] 'static' modifier out of order with the JLS suggestions.
7355,0,I will add a general error value and use it in this case.
7356,0,Resolving as fixed.
7357,0,Imagine your dependencies where stored in a CODE_FRAGMENT folder outside your CODE_FRAGMENT.
7358,0,Looking at all *Listener.java files in our source tree I see the following two cases: * a listener is just notified that an event happened but cannot do anything to prevent/block that event. In that case the listener doesn't throw any checked exception(s). Examples: GitReferenceUpdatedListener; HeadUpdatedListener; AuditListener; ... * a listener can block the event. In this case the listener throws a checked exception which is on the same level of abstraction as the listener interface. Examples: CommitValidationListener throws CommitValidationException; MergeValidationListener throws MergeValidationException; ... Since this listener is not intended to validate/block a group membership change(s) it belongs to the first category and shouldn't throw any exception.
7359,-1,exactly why i'm asking because thats what i fear!
7360,0,Nobody has any permissions unless explicitly granted.
7361,0,I did some more messing around; and I was wrong about the FS stuff.
7362,0,Can you wrap arguments like this (containing search pattern) in double quotes please? Fish shell (and probably zsh and alike) fails to execute it without it.
7363,0,(btw. this field will occupy 7 bytes for our 64 bit builds no matter what due to alignment for the next variable)
7364,0,Thanks!
7365,0,In VB.NET 4.0; most of you probably know you don't need to explicitly write getters and setters for your Property declarations as follows: VB automatically creates private member variables called _Foo and _Foo2. It seems as though Microsoft and the VS team have adopted the _ convention; so I don't see an issue with it.

When i try to upload my video my filename.flv in the folder/images/stories/videos/ ; i am getting the error as Business Agility_VS.flv: unknown Bytes: 0% Complete FAILED! :Unknown error or disk quota exceeded. What may be the problem in this?? Even i have increased the size of the destination folder. But still i am getting this error. Why i am getting the Unknown Bytes error.
7373,-1,"Im getting really depressed over this so I could really use some assistance. I created a new project in visual studio.

7457,0,Nathan; I have not been able to get the time to run the other tests.  However; I did try changing the timeoutwait.  I set it to 10000 as suggested.  The test failed as it did before.  I then decided to change it to an unrealistic number 60000.  The program died as it did before.  Whats interesting with this test is that it did not even run for a minute.  As such I dont think changing this value had any impact on the problem.

Does anyone know of a written or video tutorial that will explain how to create a list and list instance in MOSS 2007. I use WSP Builder; and the build in templates from Microsoft aren't compatible (or up to the task). Preferably a method that focuses on the CAML (xml) ; and explains in detail the theory; and demonstrates how it is done. Thank you.

7466,-1,This is horrible. First you're sleeping; which will never wait exactly the right amount of time. It may fail if the computer is busy and shutdown takes longer than expected. And otherwise it will waste time. Furthermore; you're using shared *persistent* state. The right solution is simply to free the `runOnce` mutex before calling `Application.Restart()`.

All help is extremely appreciated; thanks for the help!
7468,0,its only tests; no source code changes.
7469,1,I found the answer! It appears to be an issue with sending to the development device tokens. Like most people; we have a database that stores the device tokens; and the earlier records were populated with our device tokens from testing. As soon as I net out those device tokens from my list; all works! I really hope someone finds this useful!
7470,0,Hi Jason! I was thinking one of those parameters was the time the NM should wait before sending the SIGTERM. Alas; I was wrong ContainerLaunch.java:337 sends the SIGTERM pretty much instantly. That is messing me up in MAPREDUCE-4135. I'm still thinking having a small time delay before sending even the SIGTERM should be good. If we can do it on the NM and not on the RM; I think we might be able to conserve RM resources.

Actually I was told to keep the minimized info message to move config from autogen.lastrun.bak to autogen.input; instead of some more prominent header. I actually don't see a reason to deprecate the configuration via autogen.sh commandline arguments. For me autogen.input is just an other way to configure stuff.

7637,0,Okay; I see your confusion and edited my response with some sample code/an appropriate link to wikipedia. You are confusing the entropy of the model's probability distribution with the cross entropy (or likelihood) of the predictions it makes on real data. Consider a model that assigns probability 1 to some event and probability 0 to everything else. It has 0 entropy; but makes absolutely terrible predictions on any testing distribution that isn't a purely non-random sequence; assigning 0 probability to events that actually happen.
7638,0,The TIFF file can store various image types: Bilevel (B/W) Grayscale Palette-color RGB full-color The storing of actual image data is done differently for each image type. The is not the scariest I have seen; but it is definitely not trivial!
7639,0,here the indentation is wrong ;-) However; the main question is if the assignments should be aligned in a line or if a single space would be enough indentation...
7640,1,We ran gridmix just to be sure that the performance is not hit huge because of the locking business. And the results turned out to be in the same range of 2700-2800 secs of our previous runs of FairScheduler without this patch. I also had a look at the patch. Looks good. +1.
7641,0,It could have been created as a patch and that is far as its gotten. Assuming that we're talking we're just talking about creating a simple .snk to create strongly named assemblies when talking about signing assembly: I didn't see a .snk file in the Lucene.Net_2_9_4g branch when setting up the build scripts. I haven't looked in trunk yet.  The Lucene.Net_4e branch should have a already have a snk. I could add the same snk file to trunk and the 2.9.4 branch when I go add the build scripts to the trunk this weekend; so that all the branches are building strong assemblies. Someone would still need to go back to the tag and create a 2.9.2 version using the snk whenever the next release does come out.  
7642,0,Or at least has some relation to above problem?
7643,-1,RegEx is a horrible option for performing replaces on a large amount of text. As powerful as it is; many RegEx proponents see all the world as a nail and RegEx as their hammer. For use cases involving large amounts of text; look at FastReplacer http://stackoverflow.com/a/11442008/141172
7644,0,Hope it helps.
7645,0,So i have design a programming languages and got far enough that i wrote example code and started writing BNF. I want to know is there a checklist of things i may want to do before writing the rest of my BNF? what should i do afterward? i am afraid implementation will take a long time (its as complex as and maybe more then C++). What are things i should do or things i should consider?
7646,0,I have some comments on the new patch: PermDescriptor o You should remove the permUUID field from this class since it shadows the oid field in the superclass.
7647,0,TestMultiColumnScanner has been committed to trunk.
7648,-1,My bad!
7649,1,+1 looks good.
7650,0,I was being consistent with the hybrid pdf tooltip which used 'makes'.
7651,1,Excellent! Thanks very much. Don't understand why I did not try to find it myself. Thanks again.
7652,1,Thanks for spotting this; fixed at r487519
7653,1,There is a such thing as a [sublime-project](http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/projects.html) file which you could check into Version control; but it seems like it could be overridden by Syntax specific settings per the [settings doc](http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/settings.html); and people would likely have to use the project file to get the benefit. [This blog](http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/tools-and-tips/sublime-text-2-project-bliss/) is also interesting and applicable.
7654,0,I've just gotten a chance to look at this.  A few things jump out immediately. 1) I have to chew over the changes to Cayenne core a bit more.  Off hand; they don't seem bad; but something feels weird about it. 2) While I can appreciate the cut working like a remove; it's a bit weird to be prompted to delete the item. 3) I can't paste an ObjEntity I just cut back to the same DataMap.  With the lack of an undo feature; the only reasonable thing for me to do is a revert the datamap. 4) I think my font changed for labels.  I'll have to verify that. Looking at #3 again; actually; I can't seem to paste at all.  I even tried creating a new DataMap and was unable to paste the ObjEntity to that.
7655,0,Supplemental patch committed.
7656,0,Do we any chance to detect whether the call was made from outside the TYPO3 Namespace? Otherwise we'll get lots of deprecations if we call a public method from another class in Core; which is public but not part of the API.
7657,-1,i am working on iphone app; at once it started showing me error; with no exception; i am really afraid of this error; can any one tell me why this is happening?
7658,-1,I don't have any code to show because I don't know where to start.
7659,-1,No; but its impact is pretty minimal so I wouldn't worry about it.
7660,1,Wow; exactly what i was looking for!
7661,-1,I don't know any opensource solutions; and the guys writing this stuff for money can't and won't tell you. Guess you're out of luck :]
7662,-1,I realise this is probably an absolutely horrible way to do a query; and of course its not working. The point of it is to select users based on a date range and a keyword.
7663,0,What happens if match is missing or empty? Does it do something sensible when trying to match against an empty pattern; or should such commentlink rules be skipped (e.g.; with a 'continue;' statement here)?
7664,1,Very good one; thanks!!
7665,-1,Not sure what our own script has to do with the annotation. The export pragma could all be moved into the imp file if you prefer that. This would leave us with only the keep for where we misusing the preprocessor as template language (pme.c). I think we should replace this anynow. Right now if one runs it on any of the c++ files; IWYU makes changes we don't want. See the issues in the commit message. But I don't see how that could be fixed by using a script to read the output. It seems it would be easier to patch IWYU than replicating the header-analysis in a post-processing script.
7666,0,Thanks for the review; Sidd.
7667,-1,Someone is scared to tell the reason of -1 !
7668,1,This should almost be obvious.
7669,1,+1 looks good - will commit if the tests pass
7670,1,+1; the latest patch looks good to me.
7671,0,this was released in 1.4.9; but is now being reverted in 1.4.10 due to overwhelming community feedback
7672,0,Put all of this into a static helper method that returns a Map<String;String> already configured for the Sun JNDI names used below. Then we only need a map for connection pooling as an instance member.
7673,-1,expected about 600 users. I am worried that running 1200+ queries (should be much more than that) will eventually result in a timeout... now i am worrying whether I am creating a discussion rather than a QnA
7674,0,[error] // comments must be followed by a space and be on their own line
7675,0,There is a JIRA logged to request that 'stop' and 'terminate' be two different available actions ... see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DTACLOUD-100 - also https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DTACLOUD-111
7676,0,Then use this approach in combination with ThreadLocal?
7677,1,Hope it works; if you can upvote my answer I'd really appreciate it! :)
7678,-1,Is it possible to hide .svn files in the Open Resource dialog (Ctrl + Shift + R) of Eclipse? It's very annoying when you have hundreds of files... Cheers.
7679,1,Is there a way to pattern match in F# so that it will check to see if both elements in a two element tuples are equal. I'm incredibly new to F#; and also new to the whole concept of Pattern Matching in general. I was thinking something along the lines of... But I guess that would be too easy hah. Any suggestions? Or is there even a way to do that? Thanks for your help; you guys are incredibly helpful!
7680,1,Excellent; thanks!
7681,0,The Dremel paper (http://sergey.melnix.com/pub/melnik_VLDB10.pdf) argues that this is an essential enabler of their wide variety of interoperable systems.
7682,-1,It's impossible to receive unicast UDP packets in Silverlight (rage!!!).
7683,0,A unit test case doesn't work; -Dkey=value is not parsed in ToolRunner but passed through to SparseVectorsFromSequenceFiles; resulting in a parse error.
7684,0,+1 Looks good I just committed this.
7685,0,yes; I forgot removing that assert when the implementation changed.
7686,0,this file is a legacy code and not used; but I can live with that change
7687,0,Damn copy/paste programming.

7690,0,When you get your CODE_FRAGMENT; immediately convert to API_NAME types.
7691,-1,Using it is painfully easy to access movies from the IMDB site: However I see no way to get the picture or thumbnail of the movie cover. Suggestions?
7692,0,Also; it is worth including (in some fashion) the Service Pack downloads as well. In fact; depending on how your executables are built; you might be forced to install the Framework and the Service Packs.
7693,0,Adding a different patch.
7694,0,fixed to use reader.termDocs(null) for delete check.
7695,1,I just committed this. Thanks Vinod!
7696,0,This a patch submitted by Ankur Goyal.
7697,0,Used in CODE_FRAGMENT as well CODE_FRAGMENT methods.
7698,1,I agree this can be discovered without the text. Deleted the comment. Same in OpenKey.
7699,0,So this is ready for merging?
7700,0,That's basically all I am saying.
7701,0,You have to new it up.
7702,0,Just as we did in HBASE-770; need to check our hbaserpc to make sure it has any changes from hadoop included when we move to 0.18 hadoop jars.
7703,0,I'm not sure we need a fallback? The server should have set the version correctly.
7704,0,Voted up because I would like to know as well
7705,0,Can't we club these two cases something like : case GF_SNAP_OPTION_TYPE_ACTIVATE:         GF_SNAP_OPTION_TYPE_DEACTIVATE:
7706,1,Excellent pair of web casts (30 minute videos) where Patrick Smacchia and Filip Ekberg talk through some of the features of nDepend and how to use them:
7707,1,Thanks a lot; that's great!
7708,0,That comment came from U-Boot... I'm not sure what it implies. I guess we should leave it for the sake of consistency; at least for now?
7709,0,Entering an invalid object size limit results in displaying an 'Internal Server Error'. If possible it should display a proper error message; saying that the limit is invalid.
7710,0,hmm; looks like I didn't save all java files after mass-replace of whitespace. I will attach another patch; nothing of significance will change
7711,1,committed to 1.2 and trunk. thanks!
7712,1,Whatever you are talking about is best done by the CODE_FRAGMENT WEB_ADDRESS.
7713,-1,Sorry -- Current output is raw HTML as far as I know. I'll double check that; though. Warren -- I suppose that is what I'll have to do. Looks quite scary; though!
7714,0,Just realize that.
7715,0,That's where I'm using the extra switch; yes.
7716,1,sounds like desirable behaviour to me! How do you make it do that again?!?
7717,0,HI Christian; I've applied your patches to trunk.
7718,0,To register the bean; try calling: CODE_FRAGMENT and pass a CODE_FRAGMENT you filled.
7719,-1,I am trying to make a search TextBox with an embedded magnifying glass icon. I have the following markup so far: However; I can't find the entry in SystemColors which will give me the same color as the standard TextBox border. This is a blueish color by default. Am I being really stupid here?!? EDIT: btw; the image is contained in a stackpanel because I'm planning to put a dropdown arrow in there as well.
7720,1,Seth's answer was totally awesome! Please be sure to green checkmark it!
7721,-1,I swear - I don't put pseudo code I get told off for having bad variable names and things that don't match... I put pseudocode and I still get grief!
7722,0,Dependencies are: tomcat-embed-core; tomcat-embed-websocket; tomcat-juli and because of ( Spring websocket example - error - Are you running in a Servlet container that supports J SR-356? )
7723,0,> I don't see where this is limited to user-facing pages.
7724,-1,This is heinous. I would not allow such a thing to survive a code review.
7725,0,On rerun I let it go for 20 mins; but apart from the database getting booted (derby.log) nothing at all showed up in any of the output files (i.e.
7726,-1,I think my first preference  would be to make this only a java 7 and up feature. The change is very clear and we can use our normal testing methods.  Meanwhile users can set their umask appropriately. My second preference would be only  to only change permissions by default  with java 7 and higher. I think we really need to have tests for the default configuration and non-portable tests might have to be customized to different environments; which seems like a lot of effort for something that won't be used moving forward. I am sorry I didn't chime in earlier.  Time has been quite tight recently. 
7727,1,Thanks Andrew for covering me.
7728,0,I have a Unix command to send email.
7729,-1,Sorry everyone.
7730,1,There's a discussion related to this and one . Essentially; you use Invoke to accomplish it. Best of luck!
7731,1,I committed the patch to trunk. Could you please submit a patch for the 0.16 branch. This one doesn't apply cleanly. Thanks!
7732,0,I was somehow under the impression you were writing an Eclipse plugin.
7733,-1,I find this error when I am trying to open this file.
7734,-1,Thanks for accepting this patch. I'm sorry I wasn't sensitive to the brace convention already in the file. I probably could have javadoc'd the inner class; too :) I didn't think about the lack of thread safety of the SimpleDateFormat class: good catch. So this counts as a bugfix by markt (format was being used in an unsynchronized way prior to this patch) as well as an enhancement by me :) If DBCP typically uses localized error messages; I'd be happy to provide another patch that localizes the exception's message.
7735,0,@OregonGhost: Does it matter?
7736,0,Jacques; Why concatenate the patches?
7737,0,I am not aware of whether we have test to fill the page cache with new data; evicting all pages currently in the cache so the row count changes are written at a known point in time.
7738,1,new patch looks good to me; +1
7739,-1,Sorry for my poor review; didn't notice try/catch :(
7740,-1,I haven't had any time to try re-upgrading after having to back out 2.0.8; but I will be sure to let you know how it works out as soon as I get the opportunity.
7741,1,Well; without any third-party tools; I'd say try using the clipboard ring; but roosteronacid's idea about the snippet is probably quicker. Hope that helps!
7742,1,@Styxxy; It looks like the GPMC is explicitly designed for AD GPO's and/or doesn't support modifying GPO values; and the process for tracking registry values doesn't seem to apply to many of the Local GP's that can be modified in the gpedit.msc interface 
7743,0,NOTE: The programming language I am using is Java.
7744,0,It isn't; not at least at JPA level.
7745,1,excellent bonus tip re lcd! I didn't know that existed; but will be very useful.
7746,1,We have eclipse manage things the way it wants; and use ant4eclipse (a set of ant tasks) for continuous builds. Works great!
7747,0,i have an arraylist of objects; each containing a year/month/day / hour property.
7748,-1,That can hide an error and keep you searching for dogs a whole week while the problem was really a cat ( ch ).
7749,0,Does anyone know how to resolve this problem?
7750,0,It could be something as stupid as accidentally deleting the output file.
7751,0,We wil investigate what's going on.
7752,-1,Wide lines are a #@$# in most diff'ing tools as well; which can make code reviews a pain.
7753,0,I think it's a borderline class - architectually good for Lang; but the Math guys are going to have a better idea about the complexities to be found.
7754,0,Sorry about your signal :-( 
7755,0,Have a look at.
7756,-1,Here is a demo for the naive implementation which doesn't work.
7757,0,I think we only support mysql; sqlite; and postgresql in the migrations. (Mysql doesn't need this step because it stores  indexes in a namespace per table. This step is only necessary in postgres and sql because index names are in a db-global namespace.)
7758,-1,Why is it reading it wrongly?
7759,0,I am trying to use EqualsBuilder in the apache commons library.
7760,1,You can do it with BUT; you should look into jQuery; an excellent Javascript library which makes it really easy to do that plus a LOT more! It's worth the small learning curve; trust me.
7761,1,There is a slight improvement that you can do that uses the CODE_FRAGMENT's internal cache by using its CODE_FRAGMENT method.
7762,0,Why do you need to have the encryption of the passphrase reversible? That's not generally desirable.
7763,0,CASE_SENSITIVE boolean=> TRUE   9.
7764,0,hi; it needs to be server side; no javascript

7770,0,Updating 'Fix For'  to Unknown on issues not targeted for 0.8
7771,0,This condition is always true. I assume the condition you meant was n != ptrSize. Though I see you removed this condition altogether in CL 9704 (rebase failure?).
7772,0,The patch looks good.
7773,1,@acidzombie24: My pleasure! :)
7774,0,You could use a fair Semaphore called NotSleeping.
7775,0,For versions and dependencies please see the API_NAME at the bottom.
7776,1,This answer describes what is happening more clearly.
7777,0,And `NaN ==== NaN` will make you even angrier (syntax errors always do!)
7778,0,"You've said ""For the sole purpose of reporting"". Does this mean that the data is pulled into Oracle from some other system. If so; this would mean the design would not need to worry overly about normalization for update/integrity purposes."
7779,0,I believe this is now fixed.  The test case itself was the problem - missing suffix of ULL or LL for unix; and UI64 or I64 for windows. I am closing the issue.
7780,0,You need to the file name as you build your URL. This will escape the '#' character; allowing the browser to interpret it appropriately. Proper encoding is very important for preventing attacks against your application; which can be devastating.
7781,0,Reopening this issue and Richard will add more information into the JIRA.
7782,1,Ah; good catch. I didn't see the enclosing call to the Title class there. I was assuming the output of $request->getVal( 'title'; '' ); was being passed to $request->getVal( 'returnto'; .. ); Seems some really nasty logic going on with re-using variables and type-casting to strings etc.
7783,-1,I'm however very interested in this feature as it is essential to me.
7784,0,addressed the Cos and Balaji comments. Latest patch for yahoo security branch. 
7785,1,I'm pretty new to Angular but loving it! I am trying to create a modal dialog to display a partial view. ui.bootstap.modal has an option which takes the URL to the partial view to be displayed. I have a route configured on my application module that looks like this: I would like to show the partial template defined as from the above routes. So in my controller I'm attempting to open the modal dialog like so: The modal dialog opens but the contents are just . Do I need to define the route on the server side or can I use Angular routing to return the partial? Thanks!
7786,0,I want the next item to be dequeued when the previously dequeued item has been consumed by the caller (as there is no facility to enqueue an item again). So I am using the unbuffered channel for this synchronization.
7787,0,I just committed this.
7788,0,Alright; I'll put this and HBASE-8453 in through trunk today.
7789,-1,You must be a sad sad person...

7791,0,So if you annotate FILE_NAME only with CODE_FRAGMENT it will not get exported.
7792,0,I'm not familiar with Seam specifically; but I've seen this same problem come up when working with XSLT and other XML-based frameworks. There are generally two solutions: Rethink your page and data architecture so that the entire list written depending on a single condition. This may require a loop inside the s:fragment. Wrap the offending non-valid fragment html in a <![CDATA[ ... ]]>
7793,0,Just an opinion I guess; but I find the old formulation of: if (dy > 0) â€¦ else if (dy < 0) â€¦ much easier to read.
7794,0,volatile prevents the variables from being cached in the registers and creates a memory barrier; so that's not that surprising to see an impact on the performances.
7795,0,This question would now be more appropriate on SuperUser.
7796,1,PHPExcel; so you did wrote that library. Excellent! For now max entries of CSV is 100;000 for a test. Maybe I lurk around with it if you introduce how to do that? thanks
7797,0,However; on 10.8 it is correct to compile the test against 1.4; so that's not a problem.
7798,0,Lets fix this post rampart-1.3
7799,-1,It was attached to the wrong bug.
7800,0,"The main thing about ""Dev Mode Off"" is that it works even when the code server isn't running. Perhaps it's less useful with this change; but I don't want to remove it yet."
7801,0,DataDictionaryImpl o The header comments on getUncachedPermDescriptor() getPermDescriptor(); and dropAllPermDescriptors() look like they were copied from pre-existing methods; so they should be revised to describe the new methods.
7802,-1,FYI; if your test needs so much setup that you need a 'helper' class; you're going to have pain and friction down the line.
7803,0,Could you give me more comments?
7804,-1,I need to write some code that will buffer a line to create a polygon as shown below. From following the steps outlined; I can create polygon shapes around simple lines that do not cross themselves or have too tight curves; but as the lines I'm trying to buffer are squiggly swhirly hurricane tracks; it's really not good enough. I know there's a function in SQL Server 2008 that can do this; but I'm afraid that's currently a no go. Can anyone point me in the direction of a more complete algorithm I can follow; or any background info that could help me figure this out?
7805,-1,Sorry - the federated build is still working out kinks...
7806,0,I cannot reproduce this bug on my test machine. Can you produce it reliably? Maybe we should revert HBASE-3899 until the time we can fix it?

7810,-1,Ok. Stupid user Error here.
7811,-1,This was my bad.
7812,0,The TestFileConcurrentReader failure seems to be happening on a lot of builds. It's caused by the process running out of file handles. Maybe ulimit needs to be changed on the hudson server.
7813,-1,This half-reuse is more confusing for new devs who see this code for the first time.
7814,0,Wow; that was quick!
7815,0,The patch is fine.
7816,0,We pretty much already had the interface we wanted for this (IFixedLocationResourceStream).
7817,1,These look just fine -- thanks for your hard work on all these fixes; Dag! If they are technically correct; I say +1 to commit.
7818,0,Please take a look at WP Codex: http://codex.wordpress.org/Page_Templates
7819,1,I recently moved from a Mac + Textmate back to Visual Studio. The one thing I absolutely loved about textmate was it's find/search feature. It made navigating solution files so easy. Is there an equivalent shortcut/addon for Visual Studio?

7823,1,Good point.  I'll move to the other block of ITKDeprecatedTestDriver.

7828,1,Would it be possible for you to post the code here? That would be awesome!
7829,0,I would just need to retrieve the backgroundAlpha style before calling drawRect in its updateDisplayList.
7830,-1,Sorry; I kind of forget about this one.
7831,0,OK; works for me.
7832,1,Thanks Kathey and Myrna. The release note looks good and it passes the ReleaseNoteReader's checks.
7833,0,Use case for me: So I can compare objects against a MSSQL Compact Entity without worrying about how they typed the fields. (I am comparing an object against a compact database where some fields are name isSomething and IsSomething.) In other words; for sake of laziness.
7834,0,I will post a new patch pretty soon.
7835,1,So far i've done this for Twitter and it works very well.
7836,0,The problem here was simply that an EJBs class may not be one of its BeanTypes.
7837,0,in our continuous integration setup we use SVNRevisionLabeller and pass the variables from this to MSBuild to use when creating the compiled website dll. It's then available to .NET using GetCurrentAssembly() in the final build.

7847,0,Just a note. You don't need a plugin to do this in Firefox. It's built in.
7848,-1,Sorry; attached the file to the wrong issue.
7849,1,Thank you; Ivan!
7850,0,And I notice that the marcuse/4338 line still doesn't have latency metrics; if you'd like me to re-run for those stats; I can. Just need to rebase off of CASSANDRA-6153 (or rewrite my tool to use a known good cassandra-stress; right now it just takes the one from the same branch it's testing.)
7851,-1,Is it possible to prevent a user from editing the title of a node on the node edit screen? One of the things I really detest about Drupal is the rigidity of the title & body field in each node.
7852,0,I'm not enough of a regex guru; but there is probably a way to merge all these matchers into one regex; so that we don't have to check all the patterns one by one over the same string.
7853,0,Pushed to master.

7858,1,Haha great :) Happens to the best of us!
7859,0,Also see issues like SOLR-2608 that are ignored; i've been running lucene tests in a loop on and off for periods; and basically gave up on solr tests aswel; they randomly fail all the time

7862,1,Should the forceSync be volatile?  Otherwise patch looks good (make it volatile on commit?)
7863,1,"Hi Manjula; I think your approach basically looks good. Please see my comments below. 1) I think this code +        NetworkServerControl serverControl = null; +        int port = TestConfiguration.getCurrent().getPort(); +        String hostName = TestConfiguration.getCurrent().getHostName(); +        serverControl = new NetworkServerControl(InetAddress +                .getByName(hostName); port);// initialized for the shutdown. could be replaced by a call to NetworkServerTestSetup.getNetworkServerControl() 2) +        try { +            serverControl.shutdown(); +        } catch (Exception e) { +            fail(""Unexpected exception"" + e.getMessage()); +            e.printStackTrace(); +        } e.printStackTrace() won't ever be called; since it's placed right after a call to fail(). Anyway; I think it is better just to remove the try/catch/fail and let JUnit handle the exception itself. 3) I can't see that getNewPort() is used; so it's probably best to remove it. 4) It looks like most of the changes in TestConfiguration.java are reformatting/white-space changes. If you could post a new patch which only contained what's actually changed; it would be easier to review those changes."
7864,0,Changes look reasonable to me.

7870,0,This could be terribly trivial; but I'm having trouble finding an answer that executes in less than n^2 time. Let's say I have two string arrays and I want to know which strings exist in both arrays. How would I do that; efficiently; in VB.NET or is there a way to do this other than a double loop?

7876,0,Rest of Ender's patch was applied.
7877,0,This is fixed in V2 and an automated regression case has been created.
7878,0,So could you swap 2 user's passwords by moving the password hashes in that file?
7879,-1,I think it should be a warning. Generally speaking; the common rule is that 'you should treat warnings as errors'. If I unintentionally write unreachable code; I will see it in the warnings; and fix it anyway. However; sometimes; like Neil says; you intentionally create dead code; for debugging purposes or whatever reason. I'd really; really hate it if the compiler would not let me do that.

7887,0,Thanks Jacopo.
7888,0,I'm reasonably certain you can't shift focus to another tab. My understanding is this is done to somewhat limit pop ups and other malicious content from stealing the users focus.
7889,0,So we're wondering how do other API developers make their interfaces and beans accessible without relying on a context import ( which btw also clutters up the target context with many potentially unneeded beans; like for example if an API provides several services and I only want to use one )?
7890,0,So it's like getting a new copy.
7891,0,The attached patch fixes two problems:   * the first one which happen when the class is loaded from the boot classloader (in which case; we now use the system classloader to load the enclosing class)   * the second one which is the fact that all kind of linkage errors can happen when loading the class and this would really disturb the classloader correct behavior
7892,0,"Yeah; but this is usual wording we are using:  $ git grep ""member of the privileged 'Administrators' group""  | wc -l  20"
7893,0,If using a single FlatFileItemWriter it is enough to register it as an ItemWriter however when using the composite the adding it as a stream is also needed.
7894,0,You could write a Matcher that only accepts alphabetic characters.
7895,0,So this is by design.

7903,0,Converted from a single FlatFileItemWriter to a database and flatfileitemwriter and didn't register the flatfile one as a stream.
7904,0,Also; what's the difference between wait() and await() from CountDownLatch?
7905,0,encryption/decryption of the relevant code as well; and emit the IL. This would be another layer of obscurity that although doesn't ultimately protect you really; it does make it a little more of a pain. Also; post your question at reverse-engineering.net forums and see what those crackers say.
7906,-1,Arrrghhh; how I hate those people who downvote answers without leaving a comment as for why the downvote...
7907,-1,who the fuck is asking for scores; but not the max score; and why does their insanely specialized use case justify all these booleans on a central lucene class.

7909,0,This may result in broken implementations since they could already have a longer URL. Highly unlikely; but possible.
7910,-1,Fixed in CVS.  (Indeed; the fix was in CVS slightly before release publication; unfortunately; it didn't get tagged.  :( )  Your best bet is to use jars built from CVS for the time being.
7911,-1,it's my bad.
7912,1,This is incredibly useful; thank you!

7919,0,And then for FILE_NAME we have.
7920,0,The function is written to expect an array; but you're passing it an integer. Did you mean ? (That does at least print a list of numbers; but I'm afraid many of them are not primes!)
7921,1,I started to be thrilled only to find out that the example is ascii art!
7922,0,A workaround for this issue is to use entity resolver.
7923,0,But it would be better if you could provide a patch ;-) Thanks again.
7924,0,I just committed this to trunk and branch-0.23.
7925,0,I have registered some CellEditors with all my columns.
7926,1,ah! I had changed this routine to start from one less than the value passed but forgot to change br_init_children(). If you check fini(); it correctly passes priv->child_count. I'll fix this although it's OK not to change this as this routine is executed when the process in tearing down. So; it's probably doesn't matter much.
7927,0,Is it possible you have an older version lying around in your bin folder? Another alternative is that some other code is comipled against the older version. If all else fails you can use to force your new version.
7928,0,Why do you hate Photoshop?
7929,0,could you show the part of code where the order gets changed?

7931,0,I want to keep it for now - there might be new architectures/optimizations where we suddenly realize it would be useful. Having them in config.h.cmakein is a reasonable compromise to remember we can use them; although they aren't selectable directly in Cmake for the moment.

7936,0,I want to ask some questions.
7937,0,syncop_fsetattr failures at line 1276 can still result in failure of migration of file. Only after 1276; it is guaranteed that src will be unlinked. So; we need to set this to false after line 1276. Infact it is even possible that unlink itself might fail. So; its better to set this at line number 1359 (where ret is set to 0).
7938,-1,Oh; absolutely horrible practice. But still the answer he was looking for.
7939,0,When i run this API_NAME; their shows only the labels; and No button aor text field.

7941,0,See INFRA-4641 for some thoughts on how we could/should achieve that.
7942,1,Thanks; Daryn!
7943,0,If I understand your question correctly; the exception is because variable is not found inside the function. I'd suggest learning scoping rules in Python or read this excellent to-the-point chapter on the topic (or search for this topic on the Web!).The other thing I'd recommend is not to handle all exceptions as you've shown in your snippet. Here's why.The fixed code could look something like this:

I’m stuck on the validation process specifically the code found in Models\Dinner.cs . I have tried converting it to VB.Net using but it chokes on the Yield statement which found in the GetRuleViolations method (see code below). So my question is how would you do the equivalent in VB.Net? namespace NerdDinner.Models { }

7959,-1,I was getting the same error when I tried to submit a version update from the Organizer. What solved my issue was using the Application Loader found in the directory /Developer/Applications/Utilities. You'll need to compress your .app file and send the corresponding .zip file. I used this for my initial submission as well; I just thought I'd try the new way. What a pain! Go with Application Loader.

7963,0,If your worried about other people access your web service directly; you could check the calling IP address and host header and make sure it matches expected IP's addresses. If your worried about people stealing information during it's journey from the server to the client; SSL is the only way to go.

7966,-1,Does it make sense to start learning JavaFx if I do not have any background in UI programming? Is it more advisable to learn Swing first and then move on to JavaFx ? I tried the on JavaFx website in Netbeans and the code looked extremely complicated to me. I am wondering if JavaFx is too advanced for a beginnner GUI developer.

7975,-1,Maybe someone knows how to disable content assist only on 'else' keyword when working with PHP source editor in Aptana? As I really; really hate it with this keyword; because after newest release it's really messing with my workflow as after entering 'else' and pressing enter it replaces it with: and sometimes it decides to get rid of indents completely. Mind you I don't want to disable content assist completely; I just want to disable it for 'else' keyword.

7984,0,We're in the process of packaging combinations of our products/modules. Some of them are stand-alone some are interdependent. All versions must be deployable side-by-side. As it is we're considering two choices: One MSI per package and version One MSI per product/module and version The first alternative would mean that combinations of the same merge modules would be delivered in several packages. The second alternative represents the simpler path. Can you give some advice on the subject? Will any of the alternatives cause grief in the longer run?
7985,1,excellent idea :) I just added; tests it and works like a charm! Thanks

For relative paths; if you're doing compiling and running in command line/terminal; you need to have that studentrecords.txt in the same directory of your code files.If you're using an IDE; you need to put your studentrecords.txt under the src/ folder.

It was hard to keep the murderous rage in check.

8065,0,OK; moved back to shellfc.cpp. Implemented the std::array busines. Phew.
8066,0,Consider using Ragel That's what powers mongrel under the hood. Parsing a string multiple times is going to slow things down dramatically.
8067,1,The patch looks good now; and the tests are all running fine now. +1. Let's wait for Hudson..
8068,0,In production I would assume that you are configuring either a CODE_FRAGMENT or a CODE_FRAGMENT.
8069,-1,"How does one make M-( the default behavior for typing an opening ""("" character? I want Emacs to automatically insert the closing "")"" after the cursor when I type a ""("" character regardless of whether it's part of an M-key combination. Additionaly; I want to extend this behavior to quotes; subquotes; brackets and braces. Typing M-( is a pain; and there don't appear to be any comparable forms for those other characters."
8070,0,Committed.
8071,1,Wow! 3 lines of code instead of a page... I wish I could vote +5.
8072,1,Nice try :-) I was Mr I dont believe in magic from the very beginning.
8073,0,is there a eval function in ML?
8074,-1,sorry; should be: path -p6 < pluto-1.1.0-taglib-el.diff
8075,0,The 'dirty flags'  look to be already handled by formchangechecker.js (and in a better way too).
8076,-1,Hmm I fear I've opened a Pandora's box of higher maths! I'll see if I can understand any of those articles...
8077,0,How to find a whose is and is ?
8078,1,Great; [~jhsenjaliya].
8079,-1,The problem is that when reader contains CODE_FRAGMENT it is not reporting ready.
8080,1,Awesome! Its resolve my issue. But is there any way to copy/move files with billion of numbers and without removing existing files/folders ?
8081,0,This seems to work.
8082,0,html/ext/HtmlInputHiddenTag.java is pretty simple; all of the functionality is in its base class. 
8083,1,Wow! Actually; that's nearly what @MarkSeemann wrote; but in code :) Hope that helps.
8084,0,This question should be locked.
8085,0,Jerermy is the sole subscriber/moderator and can take care of adding other subs.
8086,-1,Is this valid ? what I'm really worried about is can you specify type and also use def at the same time?
8087,0,How bad is it if the page already exists? I'm thinking if a user needed to rerun the upgrade script for some reason; (ie they set the version number in db back down) it would be better not to have it die here but rather issue an info/warning message that page already exists. The admin can always edit the template view to suit their needs if the page already exists for some reason. Or maybe have it so the get_field db call checks to see if there is a portfolio page with owner = 0 but the title/description do not equal the default ones we set below - that way we would avoid the re-run of upgrade problem but still die on an unexpected page existing.
8088,1,Hope that helps some of you with the same problem.
8089,0,Can we not use CONFIG_MMCONF_BASE_ADDRESS for these constants?
8090,0,I'd say last Sun JDK 1.5 as it's still the one recommended for OFBiz (even if I guess most of us use 1.6)
8091,0,Fix race conditions in Balancer.
8092,0,template< unsigned int TDimension; class T > Prefer a more descriptive name for the second template argument.
8093,1,"the question just came to me from a different team. The question was ""how to query the users in the exchange server's particular User group"". Its said that the Exchange server user group is not linked to an Ad group. The examples i could get are all for querying based on AD group. I heard there are two ways either through SQL or through DirectoryServices. Either solution is fine; but through DirectoryServices will be super awesome! Thanks again!"
8094,0,How can I increase Java heap size for Carrot2 Document Clustering Workbench?
8095,0,Hi Yuval; could you please attach a sample project showing the error?
8096,0,It would be cooler if you could
8097,0,In a word: No.
8098,0,ant tests passed on my box.
8099,0,Where is the func module? Is there any docs in SA?
8100,0,Committed to trunk and 0.21 branch.
8101,0,Which outputs.
8102,0,Apply isn't the best name but we're already using update(); so suggestions welcome.
8103,-1,that's bad Content-Type from gSOAP.
8104,0,Will close this ticket if there are no issues.
8105,0,In your FILE_NAME; CODE_FRAGMENT has not been set and therefore is CODE_FRAGMENT.
8106,0,The same strange *.wdt.* package Should it be 'wst'?
8107,0,From your comments I guess you changed it.
8108,1,Source control; keep it offsite and keep it for life! You'll never have to worry about it.
8109,0,when we have @RequestWrapper/@ResponseWrapper annotion; the generated WSDL contains duplicate schemas. See test: JaxwsServiceBuilderTest.testDocLit()
8110,0,"May want to replace `""\\""` with `File.separator` to make it work on linux."
8111,0,What would you think of just exposing incRef() & decRef() as expert public methods?
8112,1,Glad to see I'm not the only one who got that! The free book is actually really exciting; it will definitely motivate you to do peer code review.
8113,0,AT what stage are you populating the ListBox? I fear you are doing it too late to be persisted in the page; if ViewState is not somehow disabled.
8114,1,"@Bober02 if u are in this industry sooner or later you will ""meet"" Martin Thompson's excellent blog; I'm glad to introduce you to it. :) http://mechanical-sympathy.blogspot.com/2011/07/memory-barriersfences.html Happy reading!"
8115,1,Yeah the patch is great. Just that it should not have been categories as a bug :)
8116,1,for flow control Steven; the question seems to be about whether this pattern should be used; which seems to be rather subjective based on the answers; but it's an excellent question for thought.
8117,0,I would suggest changing the name of this; we actually use Neutron Drivers for spec reviews (confusing I know; given line 61 below). Since each of these has it's own review team; perhaps we can somehow indicate that here?
8118,0,jars within lib / folder to your classpath.
8119,0,Installing VS2008 installs the 3.5 Framework.
8120,1,Thanks Bryan!
8121,0,Function call for single line that removes from dict?
8122,0,Marking this as won't fix.
8123,0,nit: I think this comment is sort of redundant with the code.
8124,0,Applied patch in r637925
8125,0,Olaf; Please also consider submitting a test case for this issue. This will increase the chances of the patch getting committed sooner rather then later Oleg
8126,0,"How about following the naming from Math.min() and Math.max(): public static Date min(Date date1; Date date2); public static Date max(Date date1; Date date2); Alternatively; when I read 'Returnes [sic] the least recent (oldest)""; why not call the methods oldest() and newest()"
8127,0,We should not reset the current filter here; but still need to use it for incoming read operations; and then replace it with the new filter in an atomic way below.
8128,-1,I am crying on the inside. And on the outside.
8129,-1,This is a terrible idea; as a compact on a database already in a suspect state can lose data that would otherwise be recoverable before the compact. Compact On Close should under all circumstances be turned OFF.
8130,0,Yeah; this was a word which somebody had looked up in Dacco.
8131,1,"John: first off; i want to apologize for the *extremely* belated patch review ... I know i told you i'd try to look at this months ago; but ... yeah ... life tends to get in the way of patches. on the whole; things seem pretty good -- although you were still using an interface instead of an abstract class.  Having the main API for a type of plugin be an abstract class is an important mechanism to help future proof ourselves against possible additions we want to make the the plugin API in the future; if it's an interface we can't really change it once it's released (because we might break people Impls); if it's an abstract class; we can always provide a default impl for people. the biggest concern i have about this patch at the moment is that there are no tests; and no example configs; so it's hard to be sure it's even working at all :) here's what i see as the current todo list for this issue...  1) there are some legacy SolrIndexSearcher constructors that need to delegate to the SolrCore to get indexReaderFactory ... perhaps we should have a helper method that decides which SolrIndexConfig to use based on the ""name"" ?  2) we need tests showing custom IndexReaderFactory getting used (even if it's just a mock IndexReaderFactory thatsets a boolean to show it's being used) ... this will also serve as a test that config syntax works.  3) need commented out example of using a custom indexReaderFactory in example/solr/conf/solrconfig.xml  4) sanity check this against SOLR-465; make sure we aren't painting ourselves into a corner.  5) we should make IndexReaderFactory use the AbstractPluginLoader stuff and remove the guts of SolrIndexConfig.loadIndexReaderFactory.  It looks like we'll need to add a ""single item"" version of load to the AbstractPluginLoader to make that work well. #5 is something that can be done after this is committed; but 1-4 are pretty important.  If you can update the patch with some configs/tests i'll think about the legacy SolrIndexSearcher constructors and try to figure out a good solution for them "
8132,0,You could also group the characters by language. Load each language table as needed; and when you need to switch languages; unload the previous language table and load the new one.
8133,0,I recommend juanagui's answer as it deals with pasting in non-numeric data http://stackoverflow.com/a/2673131/755404
8134,0,I just did an AMD Linux build; and all I did was remove /usr/lib from the list of libraries.  Since we don't really need /usr/lib at all; don't you think a better patch would be to remove that directory all together?
8135,1,Awesome! You have no idea how long I've been trying to find this!
8136,0,An usage example.
8137,0,Applying both patches results in clean tests (jdbc4 tests and derbyall modulo wisconsin noise).
8138,1,@BrodieG; but together; we are infinite bliss. Didn't you feel that already? :-)
8139,0,When I first read this; I couldn't help but think you were very sad about your Programs directory.
8140,1,This is really great; worked a treat thanks
8141,0,I would avoid it for module globals certainly. For variables restricted to local scope; so you can see the same function isn't ever going to need to use the builtin; it's not something I'd worry about.
8142,1,But I'm probably not an JMX expert... ;-)
8143,0,"For the final commit remove ""[part 2of 2]"" and join the ""ODFF function FDIST"" to the first summary line."
8144,1,"i kinda like the black acctually .. but that may largely be due to my prefering the ""fire"" solr logo over the futuristic magnifying glass (the red/orange contrasts nicely with the black/grey. to my mind; the ""Solr"" ""Sun"" connection has allways been really cool ... "
8145,0,Committed revision 568039.
8146,0,I'm not sure if this is a case here but if you are really worried about the gc in this case and you'd like to better control behavior of your derived maps and thus their influence on the performance of the gc in my opinion you should take a look at the usage of different kind of references (strong; weak; soft; phantom) in java.Also remember that pre-optimization is a root of all evil especially in programming.
8147,0,No need for Provider here; inject FlushCashe directly. Both PostCaches & FlushCache are singletons. So the Provider hurts more than it helps here. E. g. on line 105 it get called in a loop and returns allways the same singleton instance.
8148,0,Any ideas why this might not have been public originally?  Obviously no immediate consequences to making it public; just wondering if we should try to discourage people from using it if there are alternatives.
8149,0,"It is a matter not related with this commit; but shouldn't be an optimization if we replace '\n"" with "";"" instead of ""\\n"" so as we save some bytes in final JS? We should consider edge cases like  ';\n' in js objects; etc; though"
8150,0,Yes; but it will change the output of EXPLAIN; so need to coordinate checkin with QE.
8151,0,Postponed to 2.0.0-RC1
8152,0,OK.
8153,0,This issue is fixed.
8154,0,Ah; I think this is from sometime before when I had it  actually raising an error...In fact I think in one of the later changes I changed my mind and went back to throwing; but I guess we'll get to that later.
8155,1,Right; since you recognize EAV; I'm supposing you'll do fine :3 Good luck!
8156,1,I use following code for displaying three simple rollover images over one main background image. The code works absolutely fine with Chrome; but unluckily not with Mozilla! I hope; somebody might have an idea to improve my lines! Thank you already very much!
8157,0,I will try to review the latest patch sometime today...
8158,1,It will do the correct; ``legal ''stuff.
8159,-1,From netstat -anp | grep I at two different times; I can see HttpClient is not re-using my connections. I connect to the same host every time with different urls such as Why is HttpClient not just re-using the same connection to myhost.com every time? I have the following code for intialization of the Pool that I pass to HttpClient... I see they are using an HttpRoute and have localAddress in the equals which seems odd as HttpRoute should be equal on just hostname and schema(https/http) and that is it; right? Does that have something to do with it? Is this a bug? Performance is very crappy having to re-establish https sockets every time!!!!!
8160,0,"setting input to '-' isn't supported on Mac hence these tests fail with the error message ""sed: -: No such file or directory"". AFAIK if no input is given sed defaults to read the standard input on Mac and Linux more occurrences below"
8161,0,Back in the private beta (this question dates back to about a week after the private beta began) the discussion aspect of the site was not terribly well-formed. I didn't really want to state an opinion; merely state an alternative approach. I think the pros and cons have been adequately addressed in the other answers / posts.
8162,0,"What about: ""Get the original length of the packet (may be larger than the captured length if the snaplen (dumpcap -s) is in effect)"" (or something that clarifies the relation)"
8163,0,In App 2 if I call API_NAME ( ``Test1 '') will I get a null pointer exception or will I get 1?
8164,0,When opening a file from your hard drive into your browser; where is the document root? To illustrate; given the following HTML code; if the page is opened from the local machine(file:///) then where should the css file be for the browser to find it?
8165,0,I tried something like this.
8166,-1,Hi; I just made some more (long running) tests; and found some problems in the patch I submitted. The mechanism is working; but it shrinks the caches too quickly; and it prints too much log output (log.info instead of log.debug). I will fix those problems and submit a new patch. Sorry. Thomas
8167,0,Below are the features of Intellij IDEA ultimate edition.
8168,1,Great answer! But as @paercebal mentioned; `auto` now has a different meaning; so could you please update the table at the end?
8169,0,I've already explained the reason in one of your earlier comment.
8170,0,Test case and fix.
8171,0,This causes pretty big data structures as many of our CMaps cover 65k possible mappings!
8172,0,a big minus of this implementation is you don't think about cases when your item is not found
8173,-1,Actually that's what this change did; sorry for the noise.
8174,0,project_id is none by default here and in _delete_tokens_for_user. Is the same if project_id is not provided.
8175,0,This patch has been around for a while.
8176,0,Clocked asyncs are fixed in r19148.
8177,-1,It does not look very useful.
8178,0,i agree; i think there is no wsdl into jms sample component.
8179,0,The only reason I put it in here and not the missed snap function was that the new_volinfo was available to this one.
8180,0,However; I see that you are following the data dictionary patterns for the other permissions descriptors.
8181,-1,Deleting files in Xcode does not delete them from installed apps/build folders/etc. It's extremely annoying. If you really want your app to only run in 3.5 inch mode; delete the Default-568 file and make sure to run Clean/Clean Build Folder in Xcode; and delete the app completely off your simulator/device. It should start showing up letterboxed again. Apple is still accepting 3.5in only submissions.
8182,0,applied patch (thanks) in r1055887
8183,0,I could not find any documented limits but if I missed them somewhere I will gladly put them in.
8184,0,Converting to the new method; we'd have to run a migration on startup changing the content in meta.
8185,0,Due to the java compiler bugs Jing mentioned; I have reverted the commit.
8186,1,Agree; (it was not added as part of this patch; but I'll fix it). Hopefully we'll be able to completely get rid of these parameters...
8187,0,How can I call a custom action dll written in managed code (.net) from an installer without using an unmanaged intermediary?
8188,1,I hope fortune favors the brave :)
8189,0,89 and 90 look fine.
8190,1,We've deployed 's Plot Pack in both ActiveX and .Net flavors with great success. Great API; incredibly flexible; provides a toolbar that lets users pan/zoom/customize. It's solid; has a long track record; relatively inexpensive; and is very fast. (I'm not affiliated; by the way.)
8191,0,"A container is a concept in IoC where the object model; including dependencies (relationships between ""user"" object and ""used"" object) and object instances; reside and is managed -- e.g.; contained. The container is usually provided by a IoC framework; such as Spring. Think of it as a runtime repository for the objects that make up your application."
8192,1,Long Life MyFacesssssssssss!
8193,0,What exists for programmatically creating new rules from Java?
8194,0,Applied the patch into trunk.
8195,0,This is the old syntax that is now deprecated. BACKUP LOG is the preferred method.
8196,1,I took a quick look at D (unused locals).  Most of it looks good; but I don't understand the few places where for backward compatibility there is what looks like a useless statement just to make sure a property gets read.  Won't someone else someday follow up with patch H that removes what seems to be useless code and just take those out anyway?
8197,0,I then click on the button but I get this error message.
8198,0,Can I call GetMatrix w/out having called SetDataFrameObject? Add a bried usage description here.
8199,-1,But it isn't working like I expected.
8200,0,Extra javadoc added
8201,0,If you include the appcompat lib as you do above; you don't need to include support-v4 at all; appcompat depends on it; and the build system will do the right thing.
8202,-1,There's always the poor man's alternative of just loading a bajillion individual frames as .gif/jpg/png and having javascript display them in sequence. It would be absolutely horrible for bandwidth and memory usage; and of course no audio; but it would (somewhat) simulate video being played. Of course; on Windows platforms; you could use ActiveX and/or embed media player and play avi/wmv files as well; without ever touching flash.
8203,0,Now I want this; when the user check a shipper by EditTextView; I have from database an Object.
8204,0,You might be able to use an anti-CSRF token to achieve what you're after. This article explains it in more detail:
8205,0,One workaround is to store the client address in the session. A response wrapper should validate the client address set in the session is same as the one accessing the session.
8206,0,Be consequent with naming of method an var?   isAVisible() {     return aVisible;   } or   isVisibleA() {    return visibleA;   }
8207,1,@DrabJay: excellent suggestion! Code changed. :-)
8208,0,hmmm... this is strange... ok; we succeeded in authn; but have not yet authz; so we cannot report it here. we should report only after we have all information... where do we do authz in this case?
8209,0,I would say you should be worried about using primitives over wrappers only when you profile your application and see that the autoboxing is a performance or memory issue. In my experience memory becomes an issue before CPU cycles when talking about primitives vs wrapping objects.
8210,1,Sounds good to me. I shall handle these changes in the separate patch. Thanks!
8211,0,"correct build status capture echo's exit code"
8212,0,but I get a CODE_FRAGMENT.

8216,1,APKInspector provides both analysis functions and graphic features for the users to gain deep insight into the malicious apps.
8217,0,Minor and optional cleanup: I think we can drop support for mw:WikiLink/* at this point both here and in magLinkRe.
8218,-1,I too am concerned about the  DRDA 255 byte character string limit.
8219,-1,"You cannot design an API for logging. We should take out the ""command"" argument and have generic errors. It's easy looking at vdsm.log to discover what was the command executed before this failure."
8220,-1,This is not the answer but I figured out a very sad workaround. Extend the TextView component class In the constructor of the subclass; fire off the code ...yuck
8221,1,Dr. Klaus Schulten gave an excellent talk at GTC2010: http://livesmooth.istreamplanet.com/nvidia100922/. GPGPU computing is definitely the way to go for bioinformatics!
8222,0,I have defined an object CODE_FRAGMENT and in my controller I have.
8223,1,This is great! I figured I just had to redrag everything into the dbml.
8224,1,Excellent; thanks a lot!
8225,0,Does it care at all?
8226,0,Fixed in LUNI module at repo revision r598681.
8227,0,See http://stackoverflow.com/a/23848146/67824
8228,0,we can actually allocate a 4K buffer which would be bigger enough to store the message.
8229,1,Applied.  Thanks Simon!
8230,0,"Watch out for ""Got InvalidDestinationException"" messages."
8231,0,Also; the savings are largely index side - not likely a huge part of your RAM concerns; which are search side.
8232,-1,Sigh; I don't like this overall if can't reuse everywhere.
8233,0,Is it by mistake?
8234,0,I think there were a mistake.
8235,0,Shouldn't we try to make this idiom work well with HDFS?
8236,0,@Lance: the first one is also executing. Compare it with a named constructor: this is actually also executing code. The same goes for the anonymous constructor... But that was not the question ;-)
8237,0,i thought the question said 'specifically in SQL Server 2005'?
8238,0,When you move a host to maintenance then that calls disconnectStorageServer which should remove this definition so in general this shouldn't affect anything negatively.  The case where this would remain is in case of an error flow where for some reason it wasn't disconnected properly or something.  Even if that happens; it's not that interesting as a few leftover connections shouldn't affect the host negatively (think about FC where the host is always connected). The advantage is that most of the time (since hosts don't move between DCs very often) the host would automatically reconnect whenever it reboots (e.g. due to sanlock fencing) and it would be available to engine almost immediately reducing recovery time.  Imo that is more important. See oVirt Bug 881941 - After a reboot of both engine and vdsm domains take a long time (15 minutes) to recover
8239,0,pushed
8240,1,Committed to 0.11.1 branch and trunk. Thanks a ton Kai!
8241,0,Jar file check following link.
8242,1,If you read the FB.init documentation; there are some parameters that can be used while defining . One of the parameter is which- Determines whether XFBML tags used by social plugins are parsed; and therefore whether the plugins are rendered or not. Defaults to false.You said that in case of pure javascript the like plugin worked that's beacause you must have set to . To get your jquery code to work simply define this paramter to true which is false by default- and it shall work. Good luck!
8243,1,Hey; you're right; that idea was probably not the best approach to the problem - 0.6 looks really nice; looking forward to it :)
8244,0,"So the constructor for this class should call setUUID( permUUID ) rather than stuffing the shadowing field via ""this.permUUID = permUUID""."
8245,0,"The problem here is that you already stringified the response as JSON before passing that into another data structure (now as a string) in order to return that as JSON. So you are basically doing a double encode and the ""string"" gets encoded.So just pass in the data once: So on a small collection like this: Yo get a result like this: If you are really worried about the order of those two keys then you can use the bson ""dumps"" to go to a string then decode with the standard json decoder in order to get a native dict with the Mongo objects deserialized; then further put into your ordered dict.But really your client should not care about the order of the keys and just expect those root elements."
8246,0,The code should work.
8247,0,Spring AOP provides an option on proxy via FILE_NAME @EnableAspectJAutoProxy ( proxyTargetClass = true ).
8248,0,Sounds reasonable. Maybe mul_ZZ could (should?) even be the default locale used in Settings etc.
8249,0,The problem is that we use this draw call to also draw the thin divider.
8250,0,There are a few considerations to be careful about: 1) The hostname in service could be a vip name.
8251,0,Input welcome!
8252,1,Thanks to Fabrizio for the patch.
8253,-1,The problem is exact what mysql is telling you : you have too much data for one table. Not only the number of fields are counting towards them; but also their size.. But the real problem is in your database design; you have designed a table that is crying out for help : 'split me up; split me up!' You should your design ..
8254,0,What is the difference for and
8255,1,Thanks Stepan.
8256,0,I figured out the problem. I was writing out the NULL terminator and that's what was causing libxml2 to choke (although I could have sworn I already tried it without the NULL terminator; d'oh!) The fixed code should simply be:

8258,0,This exception is not because of absence of SunPkcs11 because i see the SunPkcs11 that i added; in the providers list.
8259,-1,I don't have strong opinions about it either way.
8260,0,"I don't think you want this - if I'm typing a document into Word and I hit K; I'm going to be very angry when your application pops up instead of a ""k"" appearing in my document. Windows allows you to assign shortcut keys to an icon on the desktop; but it limits them to the function keys or to combinations containing both Alt and Ctrl. Right-click on a desktop icon and go to Properties; and look for the field marked ""Shortcut key""."
8261,0,So returning an empty string in such case.

8264,0,If I understand this correctly: Current CPU developing companies like AMD and Intel have their own API codes (the assembly language) as what they see as the 2G language on top of the Machine code (1G language) Would it be possible or desirable (performance or otherwise) to have a CPU that would perform IL handling at it's core instead of the current API calls?
8265,1,This gem is pure gold.
8266,0,You would only need parsers and a successor to each parser.
8267,1,Wow awesome; it worked thanks a lot!
8268,0,I've just committed this to trunk and branch-2.
8269,-1,I'm still trying to understand what this new logic brings to the table...after all of this effort; we are still just enforcing that the project/tenant-id that created an entity (secret/order) is the same one that can perform operations on that entity. However; the database relationships used in the entity queries enforce this; so what does all of this do that is different? If we were doing attribute-level access control; it might make more sense to me; but entity level for tenant-id RBAC is redundant to the db queries to me.
8270,0,you can remove the access tag and set the function actually to private
8271,0,Changes to the test look good; and your method for finding which are right/wrong is correct.
8272,1,Excellent! Works exactly like I wanted. Thanks.
8273,0,@startec The question was about 4-byte floats. Which string ends with a comma? Only the tuple from `struct.unpack` has a comma.

8275,1,great question!
8276,1,Thanks 
8277,1,Wow! That was an astoundingly fast and informative response by all! I am very impressed. I will add a couple more comments below. Thanks all!
8278,1,This code works absolutely fine!
8279,-1,After installing a lot of apps; and building a few myself; I'm sure many people have been wondering about this. If I'm looking through my SD card it looks absolutely horrible; and its really hard to find folders that are mine for putting music/videos/pictures in between all the folders for different applications. Is there any conventions here that we; the developers; should try to put their apps into one base folder or has Google forgot about this completely?
8280,-1,Why would you do that? You're begging for horrible debugging sessions!
8281,0,space before ( missing. Causes reoccurring changes proposed by database analyzer in Installer
8282,1,Hi Benjamin. Did you actually take a look at the attached MANIFEST.MF? Are the import and export statements in there correct? What is in the XML above is just the maven-bundle-plugin/BND instructions to create the exact list by introspection :) If you think it would be better to explicitly list everything when creating the manifest; please state what you would like to see in there.
8283,-1,And an CODE_FRAGMENT argument type can never accept a CODE_FRAGMENT.
8284,0,OK understood. Can you re-create the patch? It's out of sync with head at the moment.

8286,1,Thanks Ivan for take a look. I'll go through and work on this weekend.
8287,0,Copy the password hash from $oldCentral to $newCentral? You should probably run that idea past Chris first.
8288,0,Are these data representative of the inputs that the function receives? AFAICT you're not storing individual collections in sub-pages.
8289,0,"How is determined which of the opcodes is actually taken during import of _xlfn.CEILING.MATH ? I think that's missing. Note that now that we use RID_STRLIST_FUNCTION_NAMES_ENGLISH_OOXML with the formula compiler; the tables in sc/source/filter/oox/formulabase.cxx are only provided for API support (of which we actually don't know if anyone is using it at all). Our internal OOXML import/export doesn't use them anymore; so any ""only for import / only for export"" usage needs to be implemented differently."
8290,1,I'm interested in seeing the answer to this as well. :) Good luck!
8291,0,I am going to repurpose HIVE-538 to clean up the implementation of the getSchema call.

8298,0,Hi Nicholas; did you solve the issue?
8299,0,Along the same vein of getting the class's METADATA_TYPE when deserializing the response; since you are checking if the METADATA_TYPE is located in the json_dict; you could reference the class's METADATA_TYPE directly. (I should have seen this in the last code review)   if DriverInfo.METADATA_TYPE in json_dict:      <body> The same applies for the properties keyword check in line 67.
8300,-1,I was wondering if there was somewhere I could get some starter kit / theme sample for ASP.NET. I am not a designer; but I need to build a prototype for a project; and if I do it myself it'll certainly be awful Do you know where I could find that (ASP.NET specific)?
8301,1,The overlapping part is an excellent point. Its also worth clarifying the question as to which is most common in the case of substrings of varying length.
8302,1,v3 up in PB. Thanks for the reviews
8303,-1,Yes; Lily; but *why*? It sound exactly what someone who develops a malicious piece of software would ask.
8304,-1,Oh God; I remember this; it was absolutely horrible. Worse; I can't remember how to fix it offhand.
8305,0,can you combine the declaration of ctstr above with this assignment ?

8313,-1,Don't want to beat a dead horse; but it is really important that you understand that this is a terrible idea.
8314,1,Hi DIGY; I like to know a bit more about this patch: 1) what test case is it fixing? 2) how did you determine the race condition? The changes to the ThreadClass is considerable and I'm trying to understand why this wasn't a problem in earlier versions. Thanks. -- George
8315,1,Committed. Thanks Robert!

8319,-1,Django is a fullstack framework; Click is not.
8320,1,Here are my tables. And here are my object classes I'm brand new to dapper and orm in general; so please bare with me. Would a many-to-many relationship be possible to map out with dapper? If so; could someone provide a coding sample; that would be extremely helpful! I am also open to switching to a heavier orm if that would make these advanced mapping scenarios a lot simpler.
8321,0,(style) could just use         c->flags.admin = !!admin_flag; to convert it to a boolean value

8323,0,The best I've come across so far ( challenge 2 here ) is.

8330,0,Hi Preben; I just applied the your patch with a minor modification on FtpConsumerWithCharsetTest.testConsumerWithCharset to use UTF_8 charset by default.
8331,0,I found the reason why we observe different behaviors with the network server: Since you run with the default security manager; you actually get derby.system.home set as a system property as a side effect (see line ca line 586 in NetworkServerControl.java) as part of the set-up of the security manager. I ran without the security manager; so I did not get it set.  I do think though; that the old behavior was buggy: I can't see why one should need to set derby.system.home explicitly to get the auto-boot behavior. Unless someone can explain why this should be so; I'll file a bug for that. 
8332,0,Ahhh; sorry; didn't realise that set -e took care of it for you.  I will have to go back and work out why it's failing but not triggering my CI system. As such; you can close this. 
8333,-1,Oh; right. That'd be the forum template that generated that. And no worries; I didn't take it personnally !
8334,0,I would like to mention something I came across recently but I haven't been able to test it yet. There is a new program called FreeNX that has set out to be a replacement for VNC. Here's the link: http://freenx.berlios.de/
8335,0,@Andy I have some thing which is similar to this and sorry if am diverting the current JIRA title.

8343,1,I just committed this. Thanks Samuel !!
8344,0,Guys this defect is 5 years old now.
8345,0,You need to make the following changes to your code: However keep in mind that this is extremely vulnerable to SQL injection; and you should also swap MySQL for PDO/MySQLi immediately if you plan to use this code on a live website.
8346,0,"However; the NPE in the framework is still an issue even if it happens when there is a ""user error""."
8347,0,Hire a force of intimidating fellows to stand behind your users while holding baseball bats. That should prevent them from doing anything undesirable with your application.
8348,1,Thanks to the two of you that answered. What I ended up doing (in case anyone else is interested!) was processing the openid login like normal; but NOT saving the new user to the database. Instead; I stored their information in a session var and asked them for the remaining information before adding them to the db and logging them in. Hope this helps!
8349,1,Excellent much cleaner!

Jonathan - are you still in the loop on this one?  What do you think? Given the fundamental differences in what a ""string"" is across different languages; there's unlikely to be a clean solution that suits everyone.

8362,0,I'm trying to get better performance out of this Oracle query (which is terribly slow). I'm an Oracle beginner so maybe someone can point out a better way to approach this query. I have a table with information on different families. I want to extract the different relationships based on a relationship type. The solution I came up with uses a hash join to query the database...
8363,0,fixed by Shane.
8364,1,Absolutely Beautiful!
8365,0,So this is not just merely a fix of deleting the tmp files.
8366,0,Fixed for comments; added new patch.
8367,0,Would it make it easier to override if we return a List?  That way if someone wants to add an adapter; they could simply add to the list instead of copying the array. This method is used in an enhanced for loop; so a list would work just as well as an Array
8368,0,Use full path in ANT_HOME; eg.
8369,1,Applied the patch with revision 170884.  Thanks Carlin for the detailed updates (and for all the fixed double-dashes :)).
8370,0,No need to include wtap.h. ou can instead test pinfo->fd->cap_len and pinfo->fd->pkt_len. But it might be btter to compare tvb_captured_length() and tvb_reported_length(). Moreover I do not see why setting it here would be useful (I might have missed something) as this function seems related to RPC over UDP.
8371,0,"The previous one says ""server assigned"".  Is the difference intentional?"

8382,-1,Im maintaining a site where I need to 'click' a link with javascript. The href is inline javascript; not a url so I cant just navigate to that url instead. Im expect this is bad practice (the rest of the site is terrible!) but I need to make the link 'clicked' with javascript. Im using jQuery. I know this question has been asked before but it seems normally people are trying to follow the link; which I am not.

8384,1,We do realize that the given glfd pointer; could now have been reallocated and hence pass all these checks still and crash; right? just checking :) Ideally if we want to validate that this is a good pointer; which we sort of cannot unless we have  a table of valid pointers and check against that etc. or hand out numbers and map that into a table.

8401,0,how did you solve it then?
8402,0,Marking as critical.
8403,1,+1 This looks good to me. Existing configurations will still work with this patch; so there are no compatibility concerns.
8404,-1,Damn.
8405,-1,Bear in mind; that the above code might not compile ( I haven't tried it out myself... ).
8406,0,This new patch incorporates a few of Hairong's comments. 1. There is no need to check LOG/isInfoEnabled() because logs are typically at INFO level anyway. 2. Change the comment in addStoredBlock() on why we log when safemode is off.
8407,-1,Um sorry; i thought this ticket was about something else - patch attached; David would you give a try?

8415,1,Committed. Thanks for the patch :)
8416,-1,Here is an example I don't understand.
8417,0,Probably makes sense to do these like HDFS-4014; sensitive changes get their own patch and the general new classes of warning can be handled in bulk in a small set of patches.

After sometime I stop seeing the effect of changes in css. When I ""view source"" in chrome and check the css; it shows an old version.

And Eclipse generates the diff in a different order from git commandline; so I can't tell what's changed by eyeballing the diff either. I've attached rebased-to-current-trunk versions of my 0001-0003; can you attach your fixes as a 0004 on top of those?
8429,0,Is `PrefixFilter` also expanded into boolean clauses? (Or is it implemented differently somehow?)
8430,0,I'd move ModelAdapterSource into the d pointer; and hide all the IPC API from the user-facing API here. That would reduce this to take a QAIM to remote; and a name for it; everything else can be internal.
8431,-1,I'm completely horrible with javascript and jquery; How do I get the content from a PHP file?
8432,0,Undefined behavior if the character is not found. Also you should not use `strstr` (with or without the typo) if `strchr` would suffice.
8433,0,You'll need to customize the formatter's CODE_FRAGMENT method; since NumberFormat normally ignores trailing characters.

8443,1,Many thanks; Neeme.
8444,0,The only thing that the convention plugin does at request time; happens in org.apache.struts2.convention.ConventionUnknownHandler; the rest is just configuration loading on start up; you might want to put a breakpoint in handleUnknownAction; and see what is going on.
8445,1,FlexUnit is pretty awesome - Also ASUnit - They are both pretty similiar and both haven taken quite a bit from frameworks like JUnit. FlexMonkey () although I haven't used it myself seems to do UI unit testing.

8449,0,However; since we want to eventually have both incremental and full reports; let's just ape how block reports work; don't jitter the incremental reports; but do jitter the start time for the full reports and afterwards tick at a regular interval.
8450,0,Logic like that has nothing to do with GroovyShell in my eyes.
8451,-1,I'm sorry Mark; I came back here to remove my comment as after building the app from scratch I have found that by default it used WhenExhaustedAction = GROW and not BLOCK!

8453,-1,I personally hate this! commands should not go to a redirected file. I think your redirect options should be off; on; verbose - and only verbose should add commands
8454,1,Thanks Anton. Fix applied to ACCESSIBILITY module at repo revision r598652. Please check it is fixed as you expected.
8455,1,Hi Jurgen; yes that's probably a good idea but not something that can be easily and/or quickly implemented. I'd like to change this JIRA to from a Bug to an Improvement so that it can be looked at in a future release. Thanks for the suggestion.....
8456,-1,Getting the ssrs add-in to install properly was a complete pain. I think it had to do with the fact that we did development on the server prior to installing the ssrs add-in. I ended up un-joining the farm; re-joining it; then installing the component. That got it to work. Then I just had to re-deploy solutions; re-activate features and re-configure my web.config.
8457,0,Thank you for any hint.
8458,1,I see. Everything makes sense now. Thanks a lot for the excellent answers!
8459,0,Because of this and HADOOP-4972; it may makes sense to acquire namesystem locks in getBlockLocationsInternal.

8464,0,Sure it's more readable; but how about:  HandlerRegistrationCollection hrc = new HandlerRegistrationCollection();  â€¦  hrc.add(foo.addXxxHandler(â€¦));  â€¦  hrc.add(bar.addYyyHandler(â€¦)); or:  HandlerRegistrationCollection hrc = new HandlerRegistrationCollection();  â€¦  HandlerRegistration hr1 = â€¦  hrc.add(hr1);  â€¦  HandlerRegistration hr2 = â€¦  hrc.add(hr2); I.e. accumulate HandlerRegistration instances right into the HRC (which can be a field of your class) rather than into local variables that you then pass as a whole to the factory method. If you want varargs; you could add an addAll() method:  HandlerRegistrationCollection hrc = new HandlerRegistrationCollection();  hrc.addAll(hr1; hr2); or with a Collection or Iterable as argument:  HandlerRegistrationCollection hrc = new HandlerRegistrationCollection();  hrc.addAll(Arrays.asList(hr1; hr2)); Note that Sencha has not felt the need to add such collection/varargs to their GroupingHandlerRegistration: http://docs.sencha.com/gxt/3/com/sencha/gxt/core/shared/event/GroupingHandlerRegistration.html Similar for GWT-P's registerHandler on their PresenterWidget base class: http://arcbees.github.io/GWTP/javadoc/apidocs/com/gwtplatform/mvp/client/HandlerContainerImpl.html#registerHandler(com.google.web.bindery.event.shared.HandlerRegistration)

When I have added the like button to my homepage for my base url; it shows 62k likes - GREAT! However on my facebook page i only have 107 - I guess these are the people who liked the page directly on FB? How can I make the 62K likes show up on my page in facebook? Do I need to add in all the meta og: stuff? Right now I only have og:image in there. Have I screwed it up for good? Or can I make FB recognize the likes somehow? Thanks in advance!

8536,0,Stefan; > the said method is not public since it returns *all* workspace names; regardless of user rights. please note that > the a session must only see/know about workspaces it is actually allowed to access. I'm working on a garbage collector for the data store. The GC doesn't care about user rights; or; putting it another way; it must be able to access all workspaces. Ideally I'd like to use a SystemSession; but you can't get one outside RepositoryImpl or o.a.j.c package (i.e.; getSystemSession(String) is package private; WorkspaceInfo is protected). I understand that these APIs shouldn't be public; but they're useful from within the core. In my case; for the GC. I'm very interested in using another way to walk every workspace; but this other way should guarantee that the repository won't shutdown during a walk operation. I'll check the solution Thomas said he'll be proposing; but in the mean time that is what I'm using. Still; I don't see why this APIs aren't public. Regards

8542,0,My point is that div_fsys1 is probably a fixed size as defined by the data sheet; and an unsigned int is not. So if it's a 32 bit value; as suggested by the fact that you're reading it with readl below; you should use uint32_t to ensure it's the right size. That struct might need to be fixed up too.

8572,-1,VM behaves like BEA; but not as RI. It seems that RI checks method name 2 times and 2 times runs through constant pool. I suppose that first time it runs through constant pool just after parsing and second time before verifying. The first check is obligatory and the second only if -Xverify is on. It looks like code is duplicated. Now our vm makes check after parsing and only if -Xverify is on. I suppose to leave it as it is or make method name check independently of -Xverify flag.

All 3 of the following operations take well under a second: However; if I write: performance degrades horrendously. While each individual operation in isolation takes well under a second on a 1920x1080 image; when combined they now take 30+ seconds... Any ideas on what could be causing this?

8628,-1,Sorry; I didn't look at the package thoroughly enough. I now see that it can be used in the non-RPC cases also. 
8629,0,I still think you also need to check that the $bi->get('blocktype') is allowed for $artefacttype->name. For example if I alter an internal media block to have the artefactid point to an image artefact I get this match: $artefacttype->name = image $a->get('artefacttype') = image $artefacttype->plugin = file $blocktype->artefactplugin = file So they are not seen as mismatched; but $bi->get('blocktype') = internalmedia so they should be mismatched as an internalmedia block can't have an image  as its artefact. So we need to check not just if the plugin is correct (eg = 'file') but that the artefacttype is of the correct subset for the block (eg 'audio; video') for the block instance (eg 'internalmedia')

8635,1,@Alex: Great :) Happy further coding!
8636,0,Well; they don't actually.  There is a distinct difference.  All same-project dependencies point directly to commits.  All cross-project dependencies point to changes.  The reason for this is two-fold. * I can't point directly to a commit in a different project because that makes circular dependencies impossible which is really important and I probably wouldn't be doing the change otherwise (this change supports circular dependencies; btw) * I determine whether or not the dependency should point to the most recent commit based on whether or not it is in the same project (that's the code here).  There's no way I can store metadata about whether this should point to a commit or a change in the PatchSetAncestor's table without changing the schema.
8637,0,would be better to directly get rid of these functions; instead of merely deprecating them
8638,-1,Fair enough. But still deleting registry entries is wrong - you won't be able to run that program again without them. You can disable service from inside your program too http://godoc.org/code.google.com/p/winsvc/mgr.

8646,1,This is Awesome Stefan - thanks a million!
8647,1,WPF is a fascinating platform to develop our next generation applications on! The ability to style just about anything; the databinding support and attached/dependency properties. Wow! But let's not throw caution to the wind because while WPF performance is great; it's not the best... yet. Definitely is a strong contender; but as developers we are still left with design principles for our front ends.
8648,0,Its probably better to include this line in a {} block to avoid inadvertent errors while making any changes around this code block as well as to make the code clearer to understand.
8649,0,The problem is that I changed the build script to use java14compile.classpath instead of java15compile.classpath for the new test when I backported it from 10.10.

8657,-1,While we're at it; there is no such thing as Unicode. Well; there is; but it does not concern itself with earthly matters like files.

8662,-1,I'm new to ror and am finding the scattered documentation extremely frustrating! When the commands rails generate model or rails scaffold are any fileds automatically created. I'm thinking here about the Id field in particular. Additionally; could anyone point me to the documentation which specifies this?
8663,0,This should only be added if the RGBZ view plugin is going to be built. Maybe the proper place to add this test is in that plugin.

8713,1,I'm trying to create a grid (matrix) of squares in a given area with n columns and m rows; and an option to set a spacing between the squares if desired. The grid should fill squares with random coloring. I'd also like to add a zoom function; so the colored squares will appear much bigger in a region that is double-clicked. Can anyone suggest a good method to generate the grid and assign random colors to the squares? If you can suggest how to create the zoom effect too that would be SUPER :) I'm new to canvas; so any method help would be great! Thanks

8715,-1,Still no go; I am afraid :/ This does not remove 'www' from the url.
8716,0,One potentially valid reason to impose some maximum password length is that the process of hashing it (due to the use of a slow hashing function such as bcrypt) takes up too much time; something that could be abused in order to execute a DOS attack against the server. Then again; servers should be configured to automatically drop request handlers that take too long. So I doubt this would be much of a problem.

So only possible breakage scenario is; if someone extends the class and use it for the purposes outside of this package which is very unlikely. (Probably we should also change the visibility to package visible).  So I think we can just take the shortcut here and not wait for an extra release to get rid of the code."

8790,0,"I just glanced through in general: this is similar to the hack patch i used exploring LUCENE-4089; though I just used a Map<String;String>.  The part i didnt like when exploring was more related to how term index/term dictionary are separated: {quote} divisor: generalize this into something simple like a Map<String;String> of codec ""parameters"" that you set on IWC/IR. split divisor from ""don't load terms index"". define these as constants where they belong. I got unhappy here in the ""splitting"" part because I wanted the divisor part in TermsIndexReaderBase; but that doesnt extend FieldsProducer (where i wanted the ""don't load"" part) and wrap the terms dict; instead its backwards and terms dict wraps the TermsIndexReaderBase... maybe we should fix that too? I think this confusing the way it is but I didnt look at how difficult this would be. {quote}  But I think maybe I was trying to tackle too much at once... still as an ""untyped"" parameter I thought it would be useful to fix the semantics all in one break rather than causing confusion down the road.

8812,0,Hi Eli; didn't realize you were going to look at TestDatanodeBlockScanner too.  I did extensive mods to it as part of HDFS-1295.  Let's take a look and compare.
8813,0,"That was actually the original code. If dest <= src and you're only copying one byte at a time; if you start from the top you'll never overwrite the data you haven't copied yet. Otherwise; you have to start from the other end. *dest++ = *src memcpy;; but memcpy is not *dest++ = *src;.  To quote from the pretty short man page:  The memory areas must not overlap.  That's the difference between memcpy and memmove. If there was no overlap at all (which we could check for) then you could use memcpy; and that would make the normal case work like it always has.  But I'm working on a change to add optimized versions of memmove for x86 and ARM. In order to test them I'm going to implement them in the chromeos tree; and then to transfer them over I've put together a big series of patches to upstream so they should just apply."
8814,-1,Although; using this outside testing is a horrible; horrible idea...
8815,-1,"Usability notes: Personally I hate when sites put the ""forgot password"" or ""forgot username"" or ""help"" links inbetween the password field; and the Login button.

And items without orders are simply shifted to the bottom. But also how multiple 'same level' items with the same order are merely sorted by key?
8852,0,Can you give us some more code?
8853,0,For others coming here for a general word count; use `g Ctrl-g`.
8854,1,This is a great suggestion.
8855,0,Becouse the web service is being used to intergrade in with a 3rd party data feed; that the customer wishes to be able to setup without having to wait for the next release of the software. E.g Excel can inport data from a web service without Microsoft kowning about the WSDL when they wrote Excel!
8856,0,In the future; I could just get around the issue by using relative symlinks for those files (I think).

8859,0,Hey Uma; I've elected not to revert the patch as-committed; since it does indeed fix the bug at hand.
8860,-1,I'm developing an OSX application () that runs with LSUIElement set (system menu only - no tray icon; doesn't appear in cmd-tab). It works totally fine; but someone just pointed out that it has a blank process name in the Activity Monitor listing. Just says nothing. Everything else in there has a name. Even other apps running at LSUIElement. I've tried to search around the web; but I can't spot anyone talking about this. What on earth should I be looking for?
8861,0,To stop this runnable; you have to call this when needed.
8862,-1,I have an .ico file with 5 icon sizes embedded in it being used as the main application icon and the System Tray icon. When it shows up in the task bar the icon is using the 16x16 format which is desired. When the icon shows up in the Notification Area/System tray; it is using the 32x32 format and Windows is rendering it down to a 16x16 icon; which looks horrible. How do I force windows to use the 16x16 icon size in the notification area? Here's my code to put the icon in the system tray:
8863,1,Besides increasing your heap; most of the time; it also helps to increase your PermGen space by using the CODE_FRAGMENT paramater.
8864,-1,For some reason; I couldn't upload the straight patch.
8865,0,"The attached patch adds a test case to RestrictedVTITest that shows that the predicate is not pushed in the following query:  select s_r; count(*) from table(integerList()) t group by s_r having s_r > 1  Only the rows with s_r > 1 have to be returned by the table function integerList; so pushing the predicate could be useful.  Committed the new test case to trunk with revision 943088."
8866,0,"Truth is that; the sheer size of CFStore (over 2K line) annoys me. I think this prove CFStore has too much things in it and we messed up at encapsulation. So I tried to make DataTracker be about dealing with the memtables and sstables as much as possible. And being able to have View not leak from DataTracker sound like a proof that we do have some encapsulation there. I'm not claiming it's perfect; but I really don't think that CFStore is our most beautiful class in there and I do believe that DataTracker improves this a bit. But there is a good part of subjectivity in all this anyway. And if people really don't like the move of the bits of querying in there; fine; I'd move them back in CFStore and leak the View from DataTracker. I would however be more reluctant to remove DataTracker altogether and put the AtomicReference in CFStore. Because this would move all the CAS related logic in CFStore and seriously there is already too much stuff in CFStore. My humble opinion though."
8867,0,I presume either that statement can now be removed or the original intention of the statement needs reimplementing?

8888,0,it looks like createMergeConflictInfo() always shows the warning; then  adding the warning should be an implementation detail of createMergeConflictInfor() and the mergeResult needs to be passed to it as a parameter
8889,0,I must admit I'm a little confused by this one.
8890,0,you have create_port function with build in cleanup; it's better to use it

8892,0,i've attached a libs.zip that contains bookkeeper and zookeeper libraries.
8893,0,Since JacobianType is the same for both transform types; why are you defining two different types? See comment elsewhere - I think it would simplify code to recognize they're the same type.
8894,-1,actually I don't know why it is like this in the login but not in the logout.. I would assume it should be the same in both places; and that this one is the more robust one..

My questions are as follows Is the URLForResource in this part of the code ment to reflect the name of my xcdatamodeld that I have created? With the URLByAppendingPathComponent: do i have to create a sqlite database called Code.sqlite or is this made automatically for me by the core-data code? what is the purpose of this method exactly? any help or tips would be really awesome!

8920,-1,But now that I think about it; it may crap out when coming back to read even on a recovered file.
8921,-1,I'm working on a webservice + AJAX interface; and I'm worried about authentication. This moment I'm passing username and password to the webservice as arguments; but I fear that this approach is highly insecure. I was told that ssl could solve my problem; but I want more alternatives. My webservice is written in php and my interface is in php + AJAX. The webservice receives arguments from POST or GET and retreives xml (in a future maybe I'll use JSON)

8926,1,I am currently using the following jQuery script to highlight rows in my table; and it works great! This works great for tables of data where each row is truly a new record; however; I have run into an issue where I have records that take up two rows of data and would like to modify the jQuery so it renders something like: How would I accomplish this in jQuery where I want every 3rd row to have a class of 'alt1' and every 4th row to have a class of 'alt2'? Thanks in advance!

How do I specify the classpath? Once I get this answered (either here or in cocoon-users which I've also asked); I'll close the bug."
8934,0,I used the same approach as Chris Wenham. Under load; performance suffers because new NotifyCollectionChangedEventArgs need to be allocated for each Enqueue/Dequeue. Regardless; in the Enqueue; send args with NotifyCollectionChangedAction.Add; the item added; and Count-1 as the index. In the Dequeue; send args with NotifyCollectionChangedAction.Remove; the item removed; and index 0.

Here we disagree.  But we repeat our-selves... and not progressing; so we can stop doing that... and progress... as whatever we have now is much better than whatever existed before.  When a user/downstream maintainer opens the service/unit/script whatever he expects to actually understand what happens there and why; and not start to dig within application to find issues and modify downstream specific logic.  At upstart of have the start/stop convention (yeah... you need something for legacy sysv; but simple if is doing the work); for systemd you need nothing as it handles the dependencies; for openrc you need nothing as it handles the dependencies.  So the discussion is entirely around the sysv scripts... I do remember that debian does have dependency management based on the header of scripts[1]  So we left with rhel only to handle...  This is why I do not understand why we need any common application downstream specific logic.  [1] https://wiki.debian.org/LSBInitScripts"

9246,1,"> Have checked in this change which can be reviewed here: http://fisheye6.atlassian.com/changelog/click/?cs=766349  > Would appreciate any feedback. I just have the feeling this entire ControlRegistry is growing over our heads. Taking a look at many older applications with older Click releases; I can't stop thinking that Click was very good for years without it. I also received a few custom components for maintenance and I don't think this change (nor ControlRegistry) is of any needed in them (or maybe simply I'm not getting the entire concept).  Of course; I'm a newbie; but my impression is that most of the advantages you list are for ClickClick. Is it possible that the problem is with the ClickClick  approach(and that should be changed); not with Click?  Many parts of Click are simple to understand and nice; but this one is not. Making it even more complex; is just a guarantee that users like me will understand it even less.  From what I saw; one of the most important parts of Click is backward compatibility. For this however; Click should remain very simple; otherwise it will get big and bloated(and it can't afford ""published"" experiments). Tapestry on the other and can do this since with every new version they throw aboard the entire compatibility; so ""experiments"" if go wrong are not that a problem - and history shows that complex things always go wrong sooner or later (latest one: with T5.2 they'll trow maven away now :) )  My wish is when I look at the Click source code to be able to quickly understand what's up there - cause only so I have a good feeling when I use it  in applications (otherwise I have that ""black box feeling"" - and it's not fun ). I think like this; are most users - those who prefer complex thing have a very huge choice of concurrent frameworks :)."
9247,0,Also; your fiddle example seems to be cut from a much bigger project with a lot of superfluous code hanging around. I think if you are able to duplicate the issue in fiddle then you should pare down the code to eliminate some of that and make it easier to troubleshoot.

9259,0,[~arpitgupta] thanks for helping narrow this down!
9260,0,We can address it in a separate commit; but I rather use only one approach for the compaction instead of having a sorted compaction as an option. Sorting will be expensive especially when we have a large number of items. If we don't have not much performance gain; I rather use an unsorted option.
9261,0,We very much prefer to not record that information in the source tree; the change history contains that information.
9262,0,Why is Silverlight included in the question title? SQLLite is not yet ported to Silverlight 2; and what you do on the server side doesn't really matter for the Silverlight client application.

9264,0,fix the launch console message

9270,0,Hi Jeremias.
9271,0,This patch has been improved a lot.

9273,0,How send imageData using POST?
9274,0,Fixed in revision 903352. The change should get published in a few hours.
9275,0,I just committed this.
9276,0,return 1 means the caller needs to reset Default ACL
9277,0,Lots of people talk about writing tests for their code before they start writing their code. This practice is generally known as Test Driven Development or TDD for short. What benefits do I gain from writing software this way? How do I get started with this practice?
9278,1,that's nice! The patch looks good Emanuele :)
9279,0,Please submit new issues for the other aspects of this that remain unfixed.
9280,0,"if (!jj_semLA || jj_3R_60()) return true; if (jj_3R_61()) return true; return false; }  The simple fix could be to wrap the lookingAhead assignment  after the call within finally block."

9282,0,I have a process in erlang that is supposed to do something immediately after spawn; then send the result back to the parent when it is finished. How do I figure out the PID of the process that spawned it?
9283,0,"If you are getting thrown off by the fact that the user/group is listed as having ""Limited Access"" on the ACLs on; say; the parent site/web. That's just a placeholder SharePoint uses to make sure people have access to at least the bare minimum set of objects (e.g. theme and other UI files and the parent web itself) to get to the list or item you actually want them to have access to. As long as the group only has access on a single list; you should have to worry about them having access to anything else."

9286,0,here i have read that it is because of active passive mode.i will try maybe it can solve my problem but i afraid that it will produce problem with multithread application
9287,0,I assume this is something that's required if signature is not provided? If so; throw an exception here; or remove it completely from code.
9288,0,We are currently stuck with this issue?

9290,0,Let's find out; how scoped beans do work.
9291,0,Add EnumSetWritable.
9292,-1,Consider the following example: In the above example; inside filterOccupied I have to use four for matching type. This becomes really painful when the records has more than ten fields. Is there a better way to do this ?
9293,1,Excellent article! Very useful :)
9294,1,patch committed. Thanks; pradeep!
9295,0,( In this case I would have used.

9298,0,Use this construct.

9305,1,I realize this is old; but there is an absolutely fabulous PHP Activecord library called; appropriately; PHP Activerecord. I've used it for several months and it blows away the other libraries. Check it out:

9313,0,My project has an object that creates a process. It this object's Dispose function; it kills the process (or tries to). However; if the program crashes; it leaves the process running and doesn't clean up. Which causes the program to fail next time because it tries to launch the process again and can't get a lock on it. How can I make sure this process is killed? I always use the object that creates the process in a block For reference I'm using C# and .NET 3.5
9314,0,Enum 8 will no longer be used one cmos_defaults loaded is killed
9315,-1,So; everything builds fine; but when we try to deploy the application to GFNUMBER we get the FILE_NAME file not found ''error.
9316,-1,I'm against such heavy committing myself; without some consensus to do so.
9317,1,Patch applied to trunk/ . Thank you!
9318,0,You might even want to change (de)allocations in this source to use gf_*() routines (as a part of this patch or separately).
9319,0,1
9320,0,this could probably be determined dynamically at build time. but not in this patch.
9321,0,It's documentation can be found here.
9322,1,Thanks for fixing it so quickly!
9323,0,I have a string like this.
9324,-1,"Sorry; I narrowed down the issue to Chrome's over-zealous caching. I was able to reproduce the problem on two separate computers in a simple project where I had upgraded from Wicket 1.4.0 to 1.4.15. But due to testing before and after; Chrome had cached the buggy version of wicket-ajax.js from 1.4.0 and did not detect that it changed with the update. Clearing the browser cache resolved the issue. Sorry about the bogus bug report."

9328,-1,I am aware of question; but not to sure how to map it to my current situation. (Rebase is scary; undoing rebase is double scary!) I started out with several different feature branches of my master: I wanted to merge them all together and check they worked before merging back onto the top of master; so I did a: Then Which leaves me with Then I corrected some bits that didn't compile properly; and got the whole feature set to an acceptable state: My problem is that my colleagues tell me that we're not ready for FeatureA. Is there any way for me to keep all my work; but also revert to a situation where I can just rebase FeatureC on to Feature B?
9329,0,string.join() is deprecated. Please use ';'.join(vmList).
9330,1,@ThiagoLovizzaro no worries; you have to start somewhere ;) good luck in the future!
9331,0,Thats why I think its good to keep them (of course as short and minimal as possible).
9332,-1,I hate it when a simple cosmetic change is invisible to me and causes my things to not work right but I forget about the change i made!
9333,0,"changing the name of JIRA from ""multithreaded"" to ""parallel"" as we've done it with forks instead of threads."

9335,-1,"Sorry for the late review. Have a few minor questions/comments.  60. What happens if have 2 instances of Consumers with the same clientid in the same jvm? Does one of them fail because it fails to register metrics? Ditto for Producers.  61. ConsumerTopicStats: What if a topic is named AllTopics?

9343,0,"What platform?"
9344,0,Links are no longer valid fyi
9345,-1,Hate to say it; but I don't think there is a way to alleviate this. I do think that it depends on the client system; though; so a faster javascript engine or machine may make it slightly more accurate.
9346,0,How about adding required Version to QP ctor?
9347,0,This; of course; depends on your debugger. Can you elaborate?
9348,0,Well I thought I am authorized; once I used my API_KEY to authorize my access to GoogleBook.
9349,0,Title is mis-leading. Can we get a title edit?
9350,0,Yes 70x indicates something amiss. 
9351,-1,I really hate asking questions that I feel were asked a thousand times before. This is one of those questions I feel others must have encountered; ; none of the supposed solutions work for me so I must be doing something wrong..... I have an extremely simple app setup. index.htm; and terms.htm. There is some textual data in test.htm. I set both and at the appropriate time after stuff has loaded. At first I tried loading terms.htm's data into an element within index using (both test and index are in the same root /assets/www/ directory; and my webview loads index oncreate) but absolutely nothing was happening. So I opted to try .ajax so that I could at least get an error message; and all I get is 'error'. Surely; it is possible to load local textual assets with JQ on DroidGap?
9352,0,Setting fix version for 3.0 - ie) won't be looking at applying this until after 2.3 gets released.

9357,0,I do not want to stop the user from clicking the same ajax button many times; but I want to exercise some control to prevent someone from maliciously clicking the button repeatedly which would cause repeated database requests. What is simple way to handle this on a jquery .post in asp.net mvc? If I put in a time delay; the experience client side will be ruined (?)
9358,1,Gosh ! you're right !!! Excellent !!!! Is there a way to expand it programatically ? I added .setOngoing(true) (to the top) but it's not expanded... (not really the top because the first one is a notification when I'm plugged to USB for tools developpement ). Thank you again my friend !

9361,1,Thanks a lot for your excellent work Shazron!
9362,-1,You forgot regression tests - it is a real pain for a manual tester to run through hundreds of forms just to check for some basic stuff which could be easier done automatic. Better spare the tester this tedious stuff; so he can concentrate on the nasty testing.

9404,1,"Hi Bruno; I like it; seems to work well at 1st glance Thanks!"
9405,0,the refactoring involved (r982520).
9406,0,First off; 16*16*3*3 = 2304 - quite modest really. At this size I'd be more worried about the confusion likely to be caused by a 4D array than the size it is taking! As others have said; if it fully populated; arrays are ok. If it has gaps; an ArrayList or similar would be better. If the Strings are just IDs; why not store an enum (or even Integers) instead of a string?

So take advantage of constants; and the same for the delimiter Hope these help."

9415,-1,My bad.
9416,1,These are good; but I think we need another test which exercises the untested path in fault.py. Otherwise; if it is in fact unreachable; we need to eliminate that code path.
9417,1,I have just come across this great API: However; I would like to also retrieve the continent. Is this even possible as I can not find it. Maybe there is another API that is freely available that will offer city; country and continent? I have tried Googles AJAX API but they don't offer continent either. Maybe I going to have to just convert what I already have into continents; how?! I hope this isn't too subjective! Thanks all
9418,-1,It sucks to lose the code readability; but it seems like a reasonable price to pay.
9419,1,"[~bikassaha] Thanks for the heads-up Bikas! This JIRA is not concerned with the Tez integration for Pig and is simply the abstraction in Pig to allow for alternate ExecutionEngines in Pig. But will certainly change this on the Tez integration side of stuff.  Thanks a lot [~cheolsoo] for continuing this! I think everything looks good from my end. I can certainly see why we may want to keep this on a different branch until everything is finalized. Certain things may still need more work. For example; OutputStats is not completed abstracted out; as it still has references to POStore which is a MR implementation construct. ScriptState/PPNL/JobStats may still need more abstraction (especially PPNL) and reworking to incorporate a new ExecutionEngine abstraction. I think what we have done here is the minimum foundation for an abstraction though; and it would be appropriate to put into trunk; but these are not my decisions to make.  With regard to public methods that were changed; I don't think most of them are a big deal; besides as Cheolsoo said; the PigServer throwing PigException. I never thought IOException was a good exception to throw; but I think reverting PigServer back to IOException as it is userfacing code is not a big deal. The rest of the method signature changes shouldn't be worrisome because most of them are internal to the project.  However; the change from JobStats to MRJobStats; while necessary (as each ExecutionEngine would have it's own type of JobStats it would present to the end user); could be problematic because it is userfacing code and would probably break people who were previously using JobStats. That I think is the most important thing to keep in mind. The task of making the PPNL and JobStats clearly tied to the ExecutionEngine should be thought through also."

9454,0,In my personal opinion; I would make theUILabels as properties of the UIView; so option 2. You can then access them from the view easily through the controller. This also gives you the advantage of reusability from the view to any controller; and since dealloc will get rid of those from the UIView; you only worry about cleanup once!

9458,0,I'm trying to decode the result of the Python os.wait() function. This returns; according to the Python docs: a tuple containing its pid and exit status indication: a 16-bit number; whose low byte is the signal number that killed the process; and whose high byte is the exit status (if the signal number is zero); the high bit of the low byte is set if a core file was produced. How do I decode the exit status indication (which is an integer) to obtain the high and low byte? To be specific; how do I implement the decode function used in the following code snippet:

9482,0,Todd; I briefly looked at the patch. It looks like you are trying to get rid of the Journal Spool in BN. Correct me if I am wrong. I don't think you can. BN makes a checkpoint from its memory state; which differs it from SNN and CN. While it does it; the namespace should be locked (for modifications); so the edits go into journal spool; which is reapplied to memory after the checkpoint is finished. Please see the design doc in HADOOP-4539.

In fact; it'll only create more work.Of course if you really hate using an you can avoid it; not that it'll really help you much: You could emulate the more functional style concept with a method that invokes an action if the object isn't ; not that this is really any easier than a check when dealing with actions instead of functions:

I know that I can run svn propedit svn:ignore from the command line to do the same thing. The problem is that I have to have everyone on my team to do that; which is a pain. Is there a way that I can put some file in a folder or set something in my SVN repository that tells it to never check a certain file in?
9548,0,I think the fact that you have SVN at the moment makes this question less obvious. A managers might avoid formalising something from fear that a poorly conceived process will trump being reactive. There are many options; and finding the right combination may require a series of smaller changes.

OTOH; they probably care more about successfully migrating their 1.0.2 app to 1.1 and this is just getting in the way. If they really want to know why their call to setLoginTimeout isn't working they can check the included javadoc.  So; if you decide it's a bug then there's a patch coming..."

9670,1,That sounds like a plan. I love peer-reviews... :-)
9671,1,Ahh yes. OK. ROMCC and all that. I forgot about that jazz. On further thought w.r.t. the naming. It should really be pcidev_t; no? That would be typedef'd to unsigned int *and* used in struct pci_path? That name would be clearer. Or are we doing to try and encode all different types of devices into a simple_device_t?
9672,0,If its just the quotes you are worried about; then just write a simple loop to dump character by character to a string ignoring the quotes. Alternatively if you are using some string manipulation library; you can use it to remove all quotes and then concatenate them.

9690,0,"bq. CASSANDRA-2444 got in the way I'm not sure what the right solution is here.  I buy the premise of 2444 that you don't necessarily want to get hammered by compaction when you're first starting up (warming up caches).  So I don't think ""check for compactions ever N seconds"" is a great policy.  But; I'm not sure ""check every N seconds; starting M minutes after startup"" is great either because it's not something a user will just guess when he's wondering ""why aren't compactions happening yet?"" Any other ideas?"

While I know Mike's original patch went this way with LUCENE-2392 (e.g. norms); I'm not sure i like it being in Similarity in the future either.  Otherwise concepts like lazy-loading norms and all this other stuff get pushed onto the sim; which is an awkward place (imagine if you have many fields).  So; I think we shouldn't really design for abuses of the API. If there are other use cases for ""named similarity"" that have to do with term weighting; I'm interested. "

Anything with a renderer seems to have serious problems. It is a lot harder to set up tests than they claim and the tests aren't stable. I have written tests for one component 5 times now using hardcoded ids. Sometimes it just can't see the component and it dies. They only have 3 short paragraphs explaining tests in their user guide and they only respond to questions about how to set it up on their google group. I would avoid using this.

I believe this was due to the fact that the job files were on the classpath instead of all of the dependency jars. Adding the job files to the classpath does not add the dependency jars they contain to the classpath as well. So; no you didn't add this; but it should be fixed (and is in the patch) Yep; that should do it; as long as MAHOUT_CONF_DIR appears before src/main/resources; we should be good to go. It should be added outside of the section of the script that determines if -core has been specified on the command-line."

10291,1,"Thanks Dawid.  bq. Yes; this is pretty much the top-n nodes reordering that I did; albeit without any optimization of how many n to take (the hardcoded magic constants should probably be justified somehow? Or replaced by a default in FST somewhere?).  bq. Deciding how many nodes to reorder is I think hard – I failed to provide any sensible fast heuristic for that and I simply do a simulated annealing to find a local optimum.  Yeah the algo is simplistic now... and it does force caller to pick the params (though minInCountDeref=3 and maxDerefNodes=Inf are probably pretty good)... we can and should make it more sophisticated over time.  We have at least one spare bit to still use in the arc flags :)  bq. One thing I was wondering is why you decided to integrate the packer with the fst – wouldn't it be cleaner to separate packing from construction? Granted; this requires a double pass over the fst nodes and more intermediate memory but it wouldn't add any more complexity to the builder which is already; ehm; a bit complex . You can compare this design in Morfologik:  Well... it's tricky.  First; I decided to change node targets to ords so that pack could use an array to (relatively!) efficiently hold node data; eg inCount; newAddress; etc.  That required making the first pass FST ""modal"" (deref'd or not).  If we didn't do this then the packer would have to use even less RAM efficient data structures (eg Map<Int;X>) I think?  Second; the format written by the packer is tightly coupled with the FST reading; ie there are sizable differences when reading packed vs unpacked FST.  But I agree it'd be cleaner if we could move packing out (eg Util.pack); and more strongly decouple packing from FST format...  One thing I'd really like to somehow do is create different classes for FST writing vs reading; and different classes for each format.  We now have write-ord; write-non-ord; read-packed; read-unpacked (and even the two readers have 3 different modes depending on INPUT_TYPE)."

Failed tasks automatically get retried.  The most robust way to do the update: given a graph id; regenerate the graph from a query of all its dependencies; sort of like a makefile. Then; since it's idempotent; it doesn't matter if it fails sometimes; and we can ignore concurrency as well since multiple writes don't matter.

10653,1,I downloaded and read Rails As She Is Spoke; what an excellent book; thanks for the recommendation!
10654,0,It's generally better to keep them open. If you're concerned about being able to read them from another process; you need make sure that the share mode you use to open/create them allows others to read them (but not write to them; obviously). If you're worried about losing data in the event of a crash; you should periodically flush/commit their buffers.
10655,0,"3d) At runtime; when we invoke the routine; we make sure that it actually lives in the declared jar file."
10656,0,That is; it checks to see if these two objects are literally the same spot in memory.
10657,-1,"flan I don't think we used such rules for comments though. Maybe NOTE(flan) or XXX(flan) ?"
10658,1,Oh; one more: You didn't seed the random number generator in the loop. Excellent!
10659,-1,I meant the findbugs addon. Sorry for the confusion.
10660,1,Yeah... I'm not a huge fan. Their documentation; tutorials; and guides are pretty nice. Here's the guide: https://parse.com/docs/ios_guide#top/iOS Here's the documentation: https://parse.com/docs/ios/api/ Here's the video tutorial for PFQueryTableView: https://parse.com/tutorials/parse-query-table (A little dated but very nice) Hope this helps! :)
10661,0,I just noticed that!)
10662,-1,If so; a test that succeeds with errors is confusing as hell...
10663,0,I have a silverlight control (View) which displays a list of items in a specified property of the datacontext (viewmodel). What I need is for the scrollviewer in my control to scroll to the top or bottom depending on where the latest item has been added to the list. (It'll always be either the beginning or the end of the list; I don't need to worry about middle of list insertions.) In WPF i'd just use the DataContextChanged event to start listening to the viewmodel; but in silverlight that event is internal. Any ideas on how to tackle this?
10664,0,DO_NOTHING_ON_CLOSE ( defined in WindowConstants ): Don't do anything; require the program to handle the operation in the windowClosing method of a registered WindowListener object.
10665,0,They are equivalent when you use them as is with CODE_FRAGMENT.
10666,-1,Apparently; the Gmail app do not let me download the attachment... this is really unfortunate :( Gmail works with !!!
10667,1,Devexpress have a good one: The RangeTrackBarControl control extends the functionality provided by the TrackBarControl enabling end-users to select a range of values. Two sliders can be used to set the minimum and maximum values: you can get them free from: hope this helps!
10668,0,Get at that with Firebug and you'll notice something about the classes of the generated dialog - ui-widget and/or ui-state are completely absent; but those are the classes that ThemeRoller uses to color UI elements! Is there some sort of ThemeRoller-compliant dialog generator; or even a script to hack the right display classes into a dialog after the fact? Or; since I'm not intending to let my users edit their own themes; do I just have to do the bit of CSS hackery that the jQuery people apparently did ; putting color information into ui.dialog.css?
10669,0,Closing all issues created in 2005 and before which are marked resolved
10670,-1,Yes; I hate how Skype tries to use port 80... I sometimes forget to change it; and then when I try to test some web thing I've written; Apache won't start.
10671,0,The above code from 2008101602 is present in the 1.1.0RC2_RELEASE so therefore existed before the 1.1.0_RELEASE so needs to be removed.
10672,1,Has anyone seen a wordpress plugin slider that will show partially the next and previous image before it slides in? OR does anyone know of one that may be easily customized to show that effect? any demos; guidance or links will be extremely helpful! Thanks very much in advance! Michael
10673,0,My idea was just to drop the parent class and move the methods down to the only inheriting class. But I can modify the __str__ in one shot.
10674,0,Patch is pretty trivial; but gives +15% on MT/SerialBench on 2-core Core2.
10675,0,"If you also want to display the date it can be done by using ""DATE /T""."
10676,-1,are you sure about this loop; which does not run ;-)
10677,0,"Colin; the approach and your patch looks good to me.  What's the latest on testing?  Eg you verified a v1 install with hsync files correctly upgraded (eg leases recovered) to v2 or trunk build with this patch? Nicholas; do you have cycles to take a look? I spent a while paging in the relevant code and the patch/testing look good to me but would be good to have another set of eyes. The patch itself is straight-forward so mostly around subtleties. "
10678,0,The video is private. Is there a copy somewhere?
10679,0,"hi charlie; if you request this feature for myfaces-core (the jsf impl itself); you have to file the issue at https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MYFACES regards; gerhard"
10680,1,The simplest solution would be to use Java 8's Date/Time API.
10681,0,@Roger: huh; this is bad; as a partial integration will seg fault; see BoostMonitor.cpp which does a cast of a boost::mutex.
10682,0,So if I'm runnin in Eclipse; this will depend on my Eclipse settings?
10683,1,"Yep I've been testing some stuff recently under Safari 5.1.5 (WinXP) recently and when you have elements with tabindex=""0""; all the elements EXCEPT links ( with ""href"" defined) are focusable. By all elements; I mean s; s etc. It's absolutely amazing for me from the accessibility point of view!"
10684,0,[~lhofhansl] Yea....
10685,0,"It looks like we have to rebuild StackMapTable from scratch during method generation. I've tried BCEL code and it looks like it already have implementation we need but I don't see ways to reuse it for now...By the way I recommend to increase this issue priority to high or blocker."
10686,0,Move to wish list since we won't include this in the upcoming G 2.1.5 release. 
10687,0,what about this case? if user selected sysprep/cloud init in run once (then we get here) but also have payload configured?
10688,-1,Ahw... that's plain sad :(
10689,1,Actually; I've just fixed it. Fiddled with ColorBox and got it working. I'm running it in a function every time the images change; which didn't seem to work with the previous lightbox plugin but does with this one. Hurray!
10690,0,"> Can we have 32-bit processes calling into a 64-bit BufferQueue or vice-versa? The 32-bit process would be calling in to a different BufferQueue; right?"
10691,-1,That sounds like some serious buck passing.
10692,0,"I think this needs to stay here? The idea is to have valid NotificationProperties We need a notification method (currently smtp and later smtp/snmp) So it cant ba validates inside smtp?"
10693,0,And DispatherConfig is this.
10694,0,What am I missing???
10695,0,"I'd have to dig a bit deeper into the blame history of this file to find out. As we can see at line 154 it's being deliberately kept open; rather than as an oversight. If it needs fixing it can be done in a follow-up change."
10696,0,maybe this runnable needs to run after the previous one's onSuccess?
10697,0,"Created an attachment (id=6729) modified SQLTransformer (in full)"
10698,-1,it is being deprecated because it is old and unsafe. switch now or feel the pain later!
10699,0,I am currently working on an n-tier system and battling some database performance issues. One area we have been investigating is the latency between the database server and the application server. In our test environment the average ping times between the two boxes is in the region of 0.2ms however on the clients site its more in the region of 8.2 ms. Is that somthing we should be worried about? For your average system what do you guys consider a resonable latency and how would you go about testing/measuring the latency? Karl
10700,0,#NAME?
10701,0,Should it be possible to rebase the change if having submit permission; but not rebase permission?
10702,0,Seems that it has moved to github: https://github.com/mono/taglib-sharp
10703,1,"Hi Willem;  I've just tried the latest version from the trunk. Now everything works like a charm. Thank you very much for such a great help.  Regards; Sergey"
10704,0,You have to do it like this.
10705,0,936-2 wasn't patching correctly against the latest flume-728 so here's an updated patchfile now that 935 is available.
10706,0,and acts accordingly to the message received and displays the message in your CODE_FRAGMENT of choice.
10707,0,This makes the test do the same where it matters.
10708,1,Somewhere on the web there is a blog post which is just a lot of scrum boards. It is really good to see how other people do it. Maybe someone can find it for us :) I think this looks like a pretty comprehensive way of doing things!
10709,0,Thanks; is that everyone has to create an account and then you will link them to Pig Confluence?
10710,0,Committed to Trunk.
10711,0,Here list is the list of all question you are having....
10712,0,That would be unlikely. It depends on the randomness of the generated account number and the number of active accounts. With managed code you have to recurse 10s of thousands of times in order to break the stack. When the probability of non-uniqueness approaches 10;000:1; then it's time to worry.
10713,0,call the function; pass the device also into the function
10714,0,shouldn't it free the allocated memory here and return null if mkstemp() fails?
10715,1,Excellent answer! Bonus marks for humour!
10716,0,Changed contributed by from Arpit Agarwal to Arpit Gupta.
10717,0,Updated code.
10718,0,The pb is not in ApacheDS; but in the startup delay.
10719,1,Thanks Lukas for pointing these issues out. Will review your fixes and do the necessary changes. The JMS transport fix should go to Axis2 Transports project.
10720,1,aaaaawesome!!!! Thanks a lot

10725,-1,"This is more obvious in this file than the other. You should be escaping the periods in your regular expressions. I know that it will match the period in the URL anyway; but we want it to *only* match the period. Also; you should use specific matches for scid; height and width; rather than the period (match anything). Assuming that you're just matching numbers; '[0-9]+'; or tentatively '\d+' would be better here. One more thing; if these sites provide copy-and-paste embed tags; these matches will need to be able to deal with those too - currently they look like they will just modify the URL in-place; and this is definitely not what we want."
10726,0,"Namit; what do you by ""describe div""?"
10727,0,I would have hopped that the URI(String) constructor would have decoded things properly (or encoded them as it happens to be here).

10734,0,Patch committed.
10735,1,"Hi Anurag; Thanks for the preliminary peek at this patch. Looks good. I like the way you handled the optional inclusion of the JDBC4-specific classes in the jar file. I recommend adding class and method comments to the test classes so that reviewers will know what these tests are supposed to stress. Thanks for the explanation of why you disabled the SecurityManager and for commenting the property file accordingly. When we do commit this patch; let's leave the JIRA open to remind us to re-enable the SecurityManager after mustang fixes its bug. Cheers-Rick"
10736,1,I love this.

10740,-1,"(minor) I suspect these CLASSERT() lines were removed in an earlier version of the patch; but not restored when the padding was added back? Without these; it us likely that a defect will be added on big-endian machines when these fields are actually used."

10749,1,ah; right -- skipping the clear would be buggy.  +1 again. :)
10750,0,"Can you expand on the difference between a Prepared Statement and a Logical Prepared Statement?"
10751,-1,You can analyse changes using the TFS API down to the level of what files have changed; but to determine what content in a file has changed you need to use external tool/library. There is a comparison/merge tool that ships with Visual Studio Team Explorer but this is still an external tool that processes the changes at runtime. Just FYI. Edit: I think I may be completely wrong!
10752,0,In order to avoid such problems in future you'd better use some IDE ( e.g. Netbeans IDE or Intellij IDEA ).

10755,1,Extremely good question! For *line 1*; it is because you cannot add anything to a list of unknown type except `null`.
10756,0,How can I make it more easier?
10757,1,I'm currently tuning a large app that uses L2S using the following process (to great success!) Start SQL Server Profiler and create a trace using the 'Tuning' template that gets saved to a file. Then interact with your app to exercise the slow spots. Stop the trace then start up the Database Engine Tuning Advisor. You can load up the trace file you just created and have it suggest all sort of optimizations. I've just created 5 non-clustered indexes based on its suggestions and my app is easily 90% faster that it was before.
10758,0,True enough....
10759,0,With PHP you can use method to run you .sh file. Pass the name of the script via post data; but be very very careful; user can modify the param to execute malicious code on your machine!

10764,0,I couldnt extract using `cabextract`; used `unrar` instead. `unrar e filaname.part01.exe` worked
10765,0,That's exactly why you should always store date and times in relation to UTC and convert them to local time zone before displaying; otherwise you risk an ambiguity.
10766,0,I would not store configuration information in the repository at all. That way you don't have to worry about SVN trying to update the config when you update your source.

10775,0,Of course it is up to you to re-organize the code to your needs.
10776,0,ASCII codes... Characters are understood as integers in the above code ( e.g. CODE_FRAGMENT is 65 ).
10777,-1,@PabloB. sir; this is sad :(
10778,0,My understanding is that APPLET is deprecated and OBJECT is the preferred tag to use for Java applets. Is this correct? A lot of Java applet examples; both on the web and in books; still seem to use the APPLET tag. Are there any browser compatibility issues that OBJECT suffers from (compared to APPLET)? Also; can you provide an example of proper OBJECT tag usage for Java applets?
10779,1,Let's imagine something like this: Later I can do something like this: Is there any way I can set the limit when using the named query; and not when defining it? I'd would really love to do something like: or Thx in advance! :-)
10780,-1,Sorry about that.
10781,-1,"Ok; I just downloaded trunk and the patch is 99% the same with mine so I'll close the issue now...One comment though and sorry for nitpicking...Shouldn't the second constructor simply be ""this(patterns; null);"" or even better ""this(patterns; ""default"");"" ? In any case I can confirm it works - it just looks a bit ugly duplicating code like that... :) "

10784,0,I'm not sure if this is actually a bug; we had it fixed; but then had to revert it.
10785,0,I made this timeout be 3600 instead; because 10 minutes was too slow with unaccelerated QEMU :(

10789,-1,In general; how expensive is locking in Java? Specifically in my case: I have a multi-threaded app in which there is one main loop that takes objects off a DelayQueue and processes them (using poll()). At some point a different thread will have to remove errant elements from the queue (using remove()). Given that the remove() is relatively uncommon; I am worried that locking on each poll() will result in slow code. Are my worries justified?
10790,0,Take a look at this class: https://github.com/dberm22/DBoard/blob/master/src/com/dberm22/utils/MediaPlayer.java You can call it with (new Thread(new MediaPlayer(PATHTOFILE)).start();

The fishy part here is just that choosing something in a project import dialog affects other projects which doesn't make sense.

The drawbacks are suboptimal performance with many joins; no full-text indexing; stored procesures (I think) and one need to replicate grants to every master node. Yet it's easier to run than the replication/proxy balancing setup that's available for PostgreSQL.
10848,-1,Sorry; Thiru; I hope you haven't already started working on this!
10849,0,Excellent; the performance is much better.
10850,0,[rvollmar 3/27/07] There are two bugs that are causing backwards compatibility issues; and I think the emails we've been exchanging have confused them.
10851,0,Since I screwed up the commit; we voted 2.1.7 down and are working to get 2.1.8 out pretty quickly.
10852,0,I think what he means is; you can't just read: myService.DoSomething() and go to the definition of DoSomething; because with IoC; myService is just an interface; and the actual implementation is unknown to you; unless you go look it up in xml config files or the main method where your ioc gets setup.
10853,1,I have never parsed ini files; so I can't be too specific on this issue. But i have one advice: Don't reinvent the wheel as long as an existing one meets your requirements Good luck :)

10856,1,@PeterGrantBue: I'm happy that my solution suits your needs. :-) Please; accept my answer if it really helped you out. Good luck with your game! ;-)
10857,0,Sure all code can be made better in the future; if you are up to it. But when I make reusable code; I expect that I can just take it into use later without needing to worry about things.

10869,-1,Is search and replace the only way to rename as asp control in the code behind file? I find this extremely annoying; but it is the only way I can find. Scenario: I'll find a variable that needs renaming (Usually to meet naming convention) I'll rename the variable in the aspx/ascx file. I'll have to go in the code behind files and search and replace. I get annoyed Are there any better ways - preferably that would not touch a similarly named variable in another scope in the project. I'm on VS2008 with resharper -- does VS2010 address this perhaps?
10870,1,+1 for this patch. Looks good.

10873,0,I checked; and git does not clear the environment to run hooks. I also can't find subversion's reasoning around clearing it; so barring finding out that there's a good reason to; I think I'll just remove this line.
10874,-1,What I don't understand is -- if one thread is still stuck; deadlocked; inside CODE_FRAGMENT; then how come all the other threads were able to get past the CODE_FRAGMENT call?
10875,0,I am working on Spring MVC project in which I need to pass an object from my Controller to JSP and then I need to iterate that object and show them in a table FILE_NAME page.
10876,1,CharSequences can also be a lot more efficient to manipulate - subsequences can be defined as views ( pointers ) onto the original content for example; instead of copying.

10897,0,This is a slightly tricky question. I am using NSDateFormatter on the iPhone but I wanted to only show a standard date without the years component. But retain the users locale formatting for their date. I could easily override the formatting using But now the date is in my in en-nz format eg 12:01PM Wednesday July 7. So I have totally killed the locale for any other users around the world. I would like to say. Give me the correct localized date for this users region but omit the years component. Since the date is being displayed as string; I am tempted to just fromat the date and then remove the year component by just cutting this out of the string.

Count and start don't seem to be used anywhere.  Maxpause is just the max of gcmaxclock's other fields; so it can be computed when we print it.  If you really want to have these as separate structs; I would still call the globals gcTotalTimes and gcMaxTimes and I wouldn't use named types:  var gcTotalTimes struct { count int64 ... } var gcMaxTimes struct { maxpause int64 ... }"

To be clear; what's going on is:  v = a[0] go func() { x = v }() v = a[1] go func() { y = v }()  There is no race involving the second goroutine; since its read is guaranteed to happen after the write of v = a[1]. The race is between the x = v and the v = a[1]. I don't understand why the race detector does not detect that misordering 100% of the time. I filed #10589 about this. At least this fixes the build so that we can detect future breakages while Dmitriy thinks about this one."

But backed off because there would be a slight loss of optimisation because as it stands; the loop is never executed if there is *no* newest file.  I guess a call to a policy.get_newest(file_set) would do it.

Currently; I am just creating a new List<object> and looping thru the original list. If the filtering criteria matches; I put a copy into the new list. Is there a better way to do this? Is there a way to filter in place so there is no temporary list required?
11045,1,SCSS is not __better__ than SASS; just different. It all depends on how you are used to writing code. If you are used to HAML-style terseness; then you could argue that SASS is better (less lines of code; less syntax like braces; etc). Just pick your flavor and enjoy!
11046,0,fragmentDescriptors probably the most appropriate name here.
11047,0,I want to show my own custom image for facebook connect. How can I do it?
11048,0,I guess this must be an unsigned integer because of the way we shift bits in the next file. However; in that case the width too is likely important; and I would suggest using gmx_uint32_t for clarity.
11049,1,I will be the sponsor for your beer the next time we meet.

11053,-1,I'm currently having exactly the same issue with Monotouch and that's why I found your question. I get the very same exception as you do. This makes me assume that I'm not facing a Monotouch issue but a basic (mis)behavior of XIBs/Cocoatouch. So the answer is: no; it is not possible. Very sad though. René
11054,-1,I have created a VB.Net lending application for a cooperative that caters to widows. The application tracks the members' loans and payments; and is also used as an accounting system. In my first release; the users felt that showing a messagebox every time an error occurs is very annoying. My solution is to output errors in a label control. The users accepted the modification; but i feel i am doing it wrong.
11055,0,Graphics Initialization.
11056,-1,This is an internal error *in the Python C code*. Something more heinous is going on here; I don't think this is an error in your Python code.
11057,0,Why not?
11058,1,Excellent! I'll add it as an answer so you can close the question properly. Glad I could help.
11059,0,The code in Java is.

11061,0,Not having doxygen documentation for the defines will generate warnings when merged to master.
11062,-1,I've set up Windsor to use constructor parameter names to map to a config file settings by convention. When a parameter is missing; it throws a very frightening : I want it to instead throw the following error: How can I do this?
11063,-1,The problem is that you never run the method; so the field stays at zero. It's a really terrible idea to give a field and a method the same name.
11064,0,which someone converted to a JSON string as follows.
11065,0,Why can't these just be run locally? I think it would be still quite useful to get net; iostat even if you're running on the local machine.

11071,0,I tripped across one puzzling sentence; but it wasn't something that you changed: In the second; longer paragraph of the BUILTIN bullet; we recommend LDAP and user-supplied schemes as alternatives to BUILTIN; but we don't recommend NATIVE.
11072,0,How do you use network sockets in Pascal?
11073,0,( If you're not using Java 8; it's easy enough to write a CODE_FRAGMENT which takes an existing one; and a CODE_FRAGMENT which takes two existing ones. )
11074,0,I the next best thing I've found so far is to project the byte buffer as a CODE_FRAGMENT and call CODE_FRAGMENT.

11076,0,Do you want me to tweak the patch to rename the alternate body header tag andif  move it to the MailConstants?
11077,1,I did a lot of VRML+Java work in college and loved it; but I feel like it's not really a marketable skill. Has anyone worked with a high level graphics API like open inventor; coin..etc that is actually in use to a degree that makes investing a lot of time in the API worthwhile for something more than a hobby?

11083,0,One question; if you need to override the decorated service why you need it?
11084,0,My suggestion is to keep track of whether or not you're showing an error at that choke point. If you have lots of places that are doing it; you'd need to synchronize them somehow; e.g. delegate to a singleton object that is responsible for displaying the UI; or use a mutex or something.
11085,0,I want to get the autoincrement id of an insert. is there a way to do it?
11086,1,I exchanged emails with Marc-André Cournoyer of about supporting Delphi on his site. Since his site uses to do syntax highlighting; and it uses syntaxes; he needs a Delphi syntax for TextMate. Turns out it has a already; so it is 90% of the way there. Does anyone know where I might find one that has already been updated for Delphi? A Delphi Prism / Oxygene one would be great too!
11087,1,It would be useful to add a short comment here with the kernel version in which this API changed; so that it is easier to clean up later.
11088,-1,but still nothing.
11089,-1,tdf#... is unnecessary. Rather document why this is done; if necessary.
11090,0,Note that I used CODE_FRAGMENT; not CODE_FRAGMENT; because the latter only processes public fields.
11091,-1,Don't use.
11092,0,Or; assuming that CODE_FRAGMENT is a specific implementation of the CODE_FRAGMENT and AInterface is the central access we could just say; A uses a certain implementation of BInterface by default and so on and actually set them internally with new.
11093,-1,I completely disagree with the answers so far. I feel that internal is a horrid idea; preventing another assembly from inheriting your types; or even using your internal types should the need for a workaround come about. Today; I had to use reflection in order to get to the internals of a System.Data.DataTable (I have to build a datatable lightning fast; without all of its checks); and I had to use reflection; since not a single type was available to me; they were all marked as internal.
11094,0,During the 10.5.1.1 test cycle this test took about 5 mins (and passed).
11095,1,Applied; thanks.
11096,0,I'm using CODE_FRAGMENT with a jackson and I was wondering if there is any better way to build a list of building an expanded version of this list than first calling then list method and then foreaching over all the Ids; calling the detail resources and appending the result to a list.

11110,0,ISpellChecker is an interface; not a defined class. Therefore any class implementing that interface can be 'injected' into TextEditor. Whoever creates TextEditor can determine what implementation of ISpellChecker it uses. And this answer describes Dependency Injection; nothing to do with IoC.
11111,-1,Coding horror!!!
11112,0,Note that without this patch; there is an infinite loop that will hold a socket open forever (and consume cpu; though very few probably in that case).

11114,0,Maybe you know it better when I show you some code.
11115,-1,Something that has always bugged me is how unpredictable the method in Javascript is. In my experience; the timer is horribly inaccurate in a lot of situations. By inaccurate; I mean the actual delay time seems to vary by 250-500ms more or less. Although this isn't a huge amount of time; when using it to hide/show UI elements the time can be visibly noticeable. Are there any tricks that can be done to ensure that performs accurately (without resorting to an external API) or is this a lost cause?
11116,0,Committed v2 patch to trunk with revision 508383.
11117,0,"Re: it does not look at nested repos if there is no one at root level And well it shouldn't. If the project is inside a git repo; that git repo will be found at import; and inner repositories will be found by the resource change event handling after the import. If the project is not inside a git repo; then we'll never pick up folders that happen to be in some git repository; but that's ok because the project will not be EGit-managed anyway. Or did you want to support git functionality in non-EGit-managed projects? Now that would be a vary major change. getContainer() just means ""get the IContainer this RepositoryMapping is attached to"". For inner repositories; this container will be an IFolder; and it will be at the root of the inner git repository's working directory. However; if the container is an IProject; it's not necessarily at the containing git repository's working directory _root_: it can be anywhere inside that working directory."

11130,0,Yes; You are right [~jiannan]; If the {{bkActiveLedgersSnapshot}} contains ledgers which are > {{lRange.end()}}; then there is no chance of being gc'ed in the current gc call.
11131,-1,I'm doing a fair bit of work in Ruby recently; and using Is absolutely critical. However; I'm really disappointed with the default Windows console in Vista; especially in that there's a really annoying bug where moving the cursor back when at the bottom of the screen irregularly causes it to jump back. Anyone have a decent console app they use in Windows?
11132,0,I like the idea of making sure that things that should be specified should be passed as method parameters in one go; rather than through chaining; which makes it a lot harder to see what is required.

Then a few days down the line your buddy gets your build out of subversion and complains that some files appear to be missing. You realize; ah crap; I forgot to add those files! How can I get a list of the files that are not under version control from subversion so I'm sure I've added everything to the repository?

11279,0,"As of now; some caller assumes that the returned ref is not nil when the returned err is nil. When this assumption is not valid; as the original code shows; subsequent actions on the returned ref would cause NPE and lead to GOXDCR crashes; which caused the issue in MB-18266. Returning a metadataNotFound err here is more correct conceptually; since this code is called from query APIs for remote cluster refs; and not being able to find the ref is an error condition. It will result in more consistent and predictable behavior -- the aforementioned issue will no longer occur."

11284,0,In WPF; how would I apply multiple styles to a ? For instance; I have a control which already has a style. I also have a separate style which I would like to add to it without blowing away the first one. The styles have different TargetTypes; so I can't just extend one with the other.
11285,-1,Any progress on this one? To embed complex functionality (including history-aware interactivity) on an MVC page without involving the rest of the page is a reasonable and common desire.

11306,-1,Restoring splitter distances has given me a lot of grief too. I have found that restoring them from my user settings in the form (or user control) Load event gave much better results than using the constructor. Trying to do it in the constructor gave me all sorts of weird behaviour.
11307,0,Please verify this issue is fixed as you expected.
11308,-1,this is just a nit and I don't actually care; but I skimmed and noticed that  other operation strings were <verb>ing; eg 'Getting'. I'm not sure how consistent that is; or if you want them to be consistent.
11309,1,Like others I'm using larger fonts; since getting on the plus side of fifty. Most recently I started using the Consolas typeface and have really enjoyed it. Fixed width indents well. The clear differences between lowercase L and number 1 and the letter O and zeronumber 0 for example also makes this a really good programming font.

I picked Gordon's because it allowed me to do an outer join and ignore rows that had an additional filtering parameter (I didn't ask for this but I was able to implement that later).

11385,-1,You are processing the newline character as if it is legitimate input. You should either read the entire line (including the newline; perhaps using a ) and then process the first character of the line or simply add a test to skip newlines in your loop logic.P.S. Converting case by adding or subtracting 32 is a really awful approach. It won't work with anything but a-z and A-Z (in the English alphabet). It won't work for most characters outside the Basic Latin block and shouldn't be used at all for characters that have no alternate case (such as newline). You should be using and instead.

11443,1,i really love the idea of it as i can create a folder for my user control; and make sub folder images; css; and put local resource file; so the whole thing is contained in one folder; and that makes it really efficient for me (management wise). but the bugger is you cant get intellisence like global resource; so is it possible in any way ?

11445,0,I think using RSA encryption for anything but key transport is abuse. Generate a new key for a symmetric cipher and encrypt your bulk data with that. Then encrypt the key with RSA. Send the symmetrically-encrypted cipher-text along with the asymmetrically-encrypted content encryption key to your recipient.

11449,-1,Linked lists have operations which a FIFO queue does not (enumerate the list; remove items from the middle; etc). So personally; I'd fear that if a list is used as a queue without encapsulation; then in future some fool (probably me) will fail to observe the FIFO constraint.

11474,1,Hi Carlos; This looks awesome! Lots of cool stuff.
11475,-1,does that make sense? why not just leave the reservation?
11476,-1,I completely agree with you on that subject. In practice I think TDD often has some very negative effects on the code base (crappy design; procedural code; no encapsulation; production code littered with test code; interfaces everywhere; hard to refactor production code because everything is tightly coupled to many tests etc.). has given talks on exactly this topic for a while now: Recent studies (Siniaalto and Abrahamsson) of TDD show that it may have no benefits over traditional test-last development and that in some cases has deteriorated the code and that it has other alarming (their word) effects. The one that worries me the most is that it deteriorates the architecture. -- There is also a between Robert C. Martin and James Coplien where they touch on this subject.
11477,1,Nothing wrong; everything is cool.
11478,0,One thought might to have another separate process count the number of rows in the table where the insert is being done to determine what percentage of them are there already.

11483,-1,I built an xml-rpc server in Python using SimpleXMLRPCServer; according to the example in the Python documentation. I'm calling it from a Python client on the same machine. The body of the server function executes very fast on its own. But I find that xmlrpc client performance is excruciatingly slow; taking one second per call. (Using xmlrpclib.) A speed-up technique I found on the web () didn't help. My connect URI is: I'm running Python 2.7 x64 on Windows 7; but it works the same for 32-bit Python 2.7.

11496,0,"I think that this class makes more sense than the Branch class because there are several places in Gerrit where refs strings are manipulated without using Branch objects.  Jgit does define some of those constants; but we cannot use jgit everywhere; particularly in GWT; which I suspect is why this class is here in the first place.  We need a good place in Gerrit for these constants; and the Branch object itself is a much higher level object than this simple class (it isn't only about refs; but rather refs and projects).  These constants feel  more appropriate here to me than in the Branch class.  I have some more changes; which I will push; which move them out of the Branch class completely.  I am willing to update the comment here if need be; but this class feels appropriate to me (based on its name and location) and I don't think that ""naive"" comment should get in the way of that."

11507,0,By definition; nothing is required when we have macros telling whether it is present or not. To avoid having to update this file every time something in one of the implementation files changes; I would move that documentation there.

The third line prints lines with 3 fields to the new file; the fourth line prints lines with other than 3 fields to the error file.Note that your code would be excruciatingly slow on big files because it executes two processes per line. This code has only one process operating on the whole file which will be really important if the input grow to thousand or millions or more lines.

11524,0,It's still an executable file. As opposed to; say; a Linux application that you build on Windows and which has a file with an extension .msi - that would most likely not be an executable.
11525,1,Excellent! Thank you so much for the thorough explanation; and for providing the demo. So `eval()` allows you to access the value stored in each variable.

Unfortunately I am running asynchronous code and I need a way to reset this flag after my fetching operation has completed.

Code upgrade problem-- If external code has upgrade you may have problem to know which is that code--> Again use comments--> And again messier So these are some that I can think about!EDIT---Some cons:You can make it more convenient to edit--> You can edit more than one code at onceYou can edit some code that you wan't able to edit (external resource before)--> Modifying is more convenient.You can make it load faster--> 1 file with 1000 KB is faster than 1000 files with 1 KB each.It is safer--> You don't need to worry about external resource being deleted!!These are my suggestions.

That means the last li item spills over #maincontainer and the script will want to move that last bit in; leaving an extra click. One way to check this: assign an id to the last li; and make the width less; and see if that doesn't fix it. If so you need to make the #maincontainer wider.

11684,-1,"I see your point; there is place for improving my original suggestion. The problem with your current code and new suggestion is: you don't respect visibility during the whole loop. But the outcome of the loop is entirely useless when current change is say a draft or when the user doesn't have ACL to submit a change for a project. Example: if this code is merged as is or with your new suggestion; and you (you don't have +2 ACL on gerrit-review; right?) would open a change that belongs to a topic; that is shared by 1 million of changes; then you would iterate through all 1 mil. of changes; just to say visible = false; right?"

You may well end up having to stop and start again; but that's nothing to be afraid of (as long as you heeded my one piece of advice). You'll learn a lot doing it.

Even then IE8 only just copes with maybe 25 cells (5x5 grid); 7 and 6 remain hopeless.

If the CMakeLists.txt states that C++ is used for the project; without also listing C; then some of those shorts tests incorrectly fail; and cmake then thinks those things aren't found. The solution was to change the first line of CMakeLists from this: ...to include C as a language: Then delete ; recreate it; and everything then works:

Replacing the allocation with  a := make([]string; 0; len(labelMap))  reduces the running time a bit; after which sort accounts for 60%.  So it is a bit slower; but not significantly. Not using sort would require creating a separate table; which I don't think is worth it.  The main reason to use sort; though; is to give a consistent return value (iterating a map is randomized). I could simply drop the sorted guarantee and return them in randomized order. At some point I would like to replace this map (and all maps in the text repo) with compact sorted lists; as some of the code already does; as I expect this is more efficient (both time- and space-wise).  Should I drop the sort altogether?"

12046,1,that's a really cool functionality of php i didn't know about! I'm not exactly sure how I'd actually _use_ it; but that's still cool!
12047,1,That would be awesome. I could report 100% success rates on all e-mails! :)
12048,-1,more than 7? How about more than 2 or 3? Remembering the argument ordering in constructors is a real pain.

12055,0,"hmm... i couldn't run your huge 7.5 MB application. Sorry for asking again; but will it be possible to post a ***smaller*** test case? Actually; that will also help you to isolate the issue. - venkat"
12056,-1,"We have released a beta version of our software; and as we talked to people who started using it; we have found that a lot of the features (which we thought were essential) were not known and not used by the users. What are the possible ways to inform the application users about the features of the application? I personally find the ""Tip of the day"" popups extremely annoying and disable them quickly. Are there better ways?"
12057,0,Thank you Ivan!
12058,0,Wouldn't it make sense if getFile() always checked whether the passed in fileName is an absolute file; no matter of the protocol?
12059,-1,That's really bad. GWT looks extremely ugly with IE8 default!
12060,1,@Joel - no worries!
12061,0,I think this fits better as an overload in UnloggedFailure?
12062,0,Fixed in trunk -r746186.
12063,0,I attached a patch to add one test for plaintext.
12064,0,Looking good.
12065,0,Any other opinions about the patch?
12066,1,Thanks Elena.
12067,1,Great answer! If I may update it to Rails 3; the json method now seems to be to_json. At least that's what worked for me... i.e. @contact.to_json
12068,1,Excellent point! :)
12069,0,I can also see this would get screwed up in Zookeeper mode if the elevate file didn't exist.

12079,1,This one by Christoph Pojer is pretty awesome! FileManager uses the FancyUpload3 script that is soon to be released for good-looking file uploads. And; it can be easily integrated with TinyMCE as well.
12080,0,Then we defer to the system class loader.

12082,0,"Yes; it is. The first part of the string ( origStr[:index] ) is everything of the given string until the escaped newline - the second part ist everything after the escaped newline - which normally holds an indentation followed by the string data. We don't want the indentation (this would falsify the results - but we don't know how much indentation there would be - so; lstrip() would be obviously the best way to get rid of the indentation. The first part cannot have any whitespaces after the escaped newline - after hitting newline we're definitely on the next line (if you go back and put spaces at the end of this line you won't escape the newline anymore but the whitespace instead)."
12083,0,You can do this for info messages too for more performance when that is off.
12084,1,+1 patch looks good.  Thanks a lot!
12085,1,Great question! :)
12086,-1,I lied. The problem is back with a vengeance... 4009 errors in 229 files. This is ridiculous! VS2013; Resharper 8.0.2.
12087,1,because it provides the lot of flexibility and improvements over using normal arrays.
12088,0,Patch looks very good.
12089,-1,This isn't a very good function name.. (I assume that it doesn't initialize everything in memcached).. init_allocation_hooks() would probably be a better name..
12090,-1,This serves me right for browsing s.o. on waking up. My eyes hurt!
12091,0,How can I write the following SQL using CreateCriteria: Attach the model.
12092,1,I'm just working my way through Django; and really liking it so far; but I have an issue and I'm not sure what the typical way to solve it. Suppose I have a View which is supposed to be updated when some complex Python object is updated; but this object is not driven by the database; say it is driven by AJAX calls or directly by the user or something. Where does this code go? Should it still go in models.py????
12093,0,In any case; the code for the toBytes method is written now; so it should be a simple thing to move it to the PType implementation classes.
12094,0,for problem number two are you adding anyting to the list.
12095,0,You can use CODE_FRAGMENT to create a CODE_FRAGMENT from JPEG data.
12096,0,"Hi Sebb; In these cases 'this' and 'connectionPool' refer to the same object."
12097,0,By the way; getCanonicalPath() performs actual file access; may take long if drive is slow (e. g. Samba); may fail with exception if path is inaccessible at the moment (e. g. on network drive) etc.
12098,1,Thanks John for bringing this up and also for providing the patch.
12099,0,I have a need to explore VOIP integration into a .Net application. It would be incredibly helpful if the toolset was usable via ASP.Net (version 2.0 or higher); and provided the developer the option to allow interaction on the client either embedded within the web browser or external to the client web browser. It should be compatible at a minimum with Internet Explorer; but would be better if browser independence were an option.
12100,0,Maybe ant could read the password like it does for GPG and handle this for us?
12101,0,The folders in the tree would be ``server ''objects ( a FILE_NAME ) created by the root ( the FILE_NAME ) which in turn have`` application'' objects ( FILE_NAME ) created by a method in the server object.

12105,0,I just applied the patch; ran tests.
12106,-1,IMHO multi-core processors are still so rare; and threading is such a horrible and hairy and dangerous place to go; that you're just better off sticking to one thread.
12107,1,In lieu of that; however; in my experience; ASM offers probably the best combination of maturity; flexibility; and ease-of-use.

12121,0,"Hi Anil; Did you get chances to review and test?"
12122,0,Which methods we talking about here?
12123,0,Your question assumes that mail clients follow the RFC standards for MIME encoding; which they don't. I'd advise you collect a bunch of mail from sources and try and process it as-it-exists. The problem you are facing is extremely difficult (perhaps impossible) to solve 100%.
12124,0,If your ``GUID ''is a CODE_FRAGMENT then the probabilities are quite low.
12125,0,"Thanks!"
12126,-1,The usage of exception specification here is very bad! If any only exception is thrown; then the program will terminate. Imagine what will happen if that occurred in Slicer! Have you verified that not a single method usage can throw an exception of a different kind?

12131,0,True.

12133,0,Yes when exception is caught it will set the subnets to [] and then L299 will return empty list.
12134,0,Here is the equivalent C prototype for the Delphi function: int csd_HandleData(char* aBuf; int aLen); Nothing earth-shattering; but maybe it will get an answer from someone afraid to contribute because of unfamiliarity with Delphi.
12135,0,Galileo came out the other day; and even though plugins under Eclipse are; IMO; just a little bit easier to deal with than ; it would still be really awesome if there was a simple way for me to upgrade to the new version (and take my plugins with me). Any tips?
12136,0,The documentation mentioned has no clear path to completion.
12137,-1,I'm developing a propietary (non Open Source) Web Application in ASP.NET; and I want to use the Look And Feel of Joomla (images; control distribution; etc.). Is this illegal? I'm violating the license doing this?
12138,0,I'm working with JBoss 6.1 and just hit this issue. There's no emptySessionPath option in my server.xml. So; how can this be done for version 6.1?
12139,0,Have passed all the local unit tests.
12140,0,er; take two; uploaded wrong thing.
12141,0,If they press Enter it should break the While loop and move onto the next statement; right?
12142,0,could we get rid of normal?
12143,1,I don't think there are any mature components too (for what I saw). You can use some dedicated DHTML components; like . We use it a lot in our project for our customers; and it's really great !
12144,-1,Do we really need a separate header for two trivial definitions?
12145,0,Of course it is.
12146,0,I think *both* initramfs and kernel image should be downloaded even if one of these files already exists. Otherwise we might end up with a version of a kernel different from that of the modules (in initramfs).
12147,0,Done; added QT_DEPRECATED_SINCE check; and changed to QT_DEPRECATED
12148,0,I think; we should replace this by getBySeverity() to avoid juggling with message types in userland
12149,-1,too bad this behavior isn't a setting. I think it makes sense in theory why they did it this way; but in practice it's just really annoying
12150,1,Before you go that route; have you seen this: It's a series of articles about writing Effects (supported in .NET 3.5SP1) as fragment shaders that run on your GPU... Pretty neat stuff!
12151,1,"I've now ported the fix to 2.0.4 and deployed  a new snapshot.   Could someone give it a try to make sure it really is fixed so that we can close this off for 2.0.4? Thanks!"
12152,1,Committed. Thanks Ning
12153,0,If you're really worried about the if statement; you have a Stateful object. This class delegates the work to a object which is either a or a object. The object will actually load. The will not load. Note that there are no if-statements.
12154,1,I've committed this to trunk; branch-2; and branch-2.2.  Yingda; thank you for the patch.  Chuan; thank you for help with the code review.
12155,0,I polished and fixed CS as well.
12156,0,Will take a look at it.
12157,0,Use `locale` and it's string collation methods to sort naturally according to current locale.
12158,1,"First sorry for the delay. It looks like this patch slipped through. I tried to apply it; but there are a bunch of conflicts (some of them are related to recent docstring format changes and other seem to be related to other changes). Can you please re-generate the patch against the latest trunk? Thanks!"
12159,0,"Hi Malcolm; updated for the latest check-style. Christian"
12160,1,I always seem to use Get when working with data (strongly typed or otherwise) from the database and I have never really needed to use Fill although I just as easily could use Fill instead of get when pulling out and updating data. Can anyone provide guidance as to the implications and gotchas of each method? In what situations is it preferable to use one or the other? Any performance implications? Thanks in advance for the answers! I love this community!
12161,-1,"I didn't do that because that seems bad in hive; so I returned ""null"" from the operation."
12162,-1,ouch. I have a large table; and the row by row insert is very painful

12166,0,No - unfortunately I do not have enough knowledge to digg into OpenJPA's code
12167,0,AFAIK there are no native language constructs for this. If you need it for debugging purposes I would advice you to have deeper look into the xdebug extension especially (awesome! :) Another idea would be to implement in your class and wrap all public methods. But this requires to change the code and has other side effects: (simplified example) . Example:
12168,0,This is a really cool idea; but I don't think this is going to make it into TRUNK before the 0.4 branch gets cut.
12169,1,Thanks for reporting; solved!
12170,1,+1 for makeself. I totally loved that. :)
12171,0,"Even during the full-blown ""validation"" of the descriptors (done just before ""saving""); the CDE is invoking the base UIMA framework in  special mode to prevent instantiation."
12172,1,excellent! exactly what I was looking for. Thanks Anna.
12173,1,"Yes; assuming the modelService works :)  This private method does not rely on other services.  Also; model service may have issues with elements that have the same ID.  In theory I could put the same element with the same id multiple times in a menu.  I don't know if modelService would be able to resolve that.  At least here we can count and validate if need be. I will make the other changes and await response on this."
12174,1,I'm writing a kernel (2.6.28) module that uses a dynamic timer. I'm using the timer_list structure as follows: This works ok for about 2 seconds until the timer expires.

12189,1,Thanks henry and pat... we'll have to re submit all the PA's so trigger hudson.
12190,0,If regionnames were made of tablename+endrow instead of tablename+startrow; then in the metatables; doing a search for the region that contains the wanted row; we'd just have to open a scanner using passed row and the first row found by the scan would be that of the region we need (If offlined parent; we'd have to scan to the next row).
12191,1,"First I was afraid to ask such ""simple"" question; but it was worth it!"
12192,0,Dojo [0] and Ext.js [1] take both a different approach (which i personally don't really like).
12193,0,Actually; in case of invalid argument the process gets started fine; it's just that it gets immediately exited afterwards (see line 95).
12194,1,I just committed this. Thanks; Jitendra!
12195,-1,OK; I can continue to do web dev on my mac by sharing the webdev folder on my ubuntu laptop. This is a really terrible solution though.

12199,0,You can use with an existing profile:
12200,-1,It's very painful to add multiple tickets to Trac or to have it as your own todo list. That causes people to use their own task management tools so tasks are then spread all around. Is there any plugin or macro that would quicken the process of adding a ticket?
12201,0,Correction to the design of this feature (I can't edit comments because of permissions; so adding another comment). In case the seconds field needs more than 31 bit; the first VInt is {{-1-reversedDecimal}} regardless of whether {{reversedDecimal}} is zero or not.
12202,0,I'm talking about . With streaming stackoverflow podcasts and downloading the lastest updates to ubuntu; I would like to have QoS working so I can use stackoverflow without my http connections timing out or taking forever. I'm using an iConnect 624 ADSL modem which has QoS built-in but I can't seem to get it to work. Is it even possible to control the downstream (ie. from ISP to your modem)?
12203,-1,Sorry; here's the test that reproduces the issue.
12204,1,"Fixed. Thanks for report (even if I'm not sure empty password is a good idea :-) )."
12205,1,that is what I am doing now. I find this a more practical solution and I see there are other people doing the same. Well; great!
12206,0,I've hit this before. It has to do with the fact that lucene; under the covers; turns many (all?) things into boolean queries when you call Query.rewrite() From:
12207,0,The tricky thing with all the stacktraces we have as of now is that they don't seem to be the cause of the issue. Something is eating all the memory and as a consequence stuff starts to go wrong in arbitrary places. We need to find whatever is eating the memory in the first place. It might be very well be releated to the security provider. Can you try to run a memory profiler and see whether you can spot what is holding all the memory?
12208,0,Btw; you can also try apache http components.
12209,0,"sure only ""/"" works. if path="""" that's considered as no path defined."
12210,1,I think you should get rid of the open-ended version spec [1.2;) as it occasionally screws things up by bringing in snapshots or non-working code. Otherwise; to my eyes; it looks good.
12211,0,What Ant version you are using?
12212,0,I think there should be a maximum size; and scrolling should start from there. with 53 options; there would be a good case for implementing a tab-structure in the dialog.
12213,1,Hey; you guys are great; thanks a whole bunch! I will set up the environment in the cron script.
12214,-1,(For the record; I find the Infragistics WinForms controls to be considerably easier than their ASP.NET controls. I think a lot of their bad rep comes from the ASP.NET side of the world; where certain tasks become a major pain and their Viewstate usage is off the charts.)

12230,-1,Sorry I put a comment here which was for another issue (tired as said already)
12231,0,InstanceDescription can be extended with HandlerDescription without pain. Only problem is a contribution to ComponentTypeDescription by custom handlers. Simple slot for custom handlers to keep their information in displayable format would be sufficient.

12233,1,"I want to find out how long time there is till a specific from . I have searched everywhere; but can't really find anything.

Ex: 06/08/2012 23:55 is ""1 day and 13 minutes from now"" I really hope you guys can help! :)"
12234,1,"OK; thanks.  The approach here and in my patch work fine if the user controls everything they way they want.  When auto-detecting everything; this patch is better on non-AVX hardware that happens to have RDTSCP. Otherwise; they effectively work the same.  When compiling on a new build host for old compute nodes; this patch will sometimes require the user to make two active settings to make a functional mdrun. That might mean they go hunting for docs twice; unless they find the new install guide section. At least we don't fail mysteriously any more!  When compiling on an old build host for new compute nodes; both patches will sometimes make an mdrun that could be better in up to two ways. We could add a nag message for the double negation of the new code in gmx_detect_hardware.c ""You; too; could be using RDTSCP!"". AFAIK the proposition that using RDTSCP is good in user space is just educated guesswork; though.  I was slightly concerned about one of the latter cases (build host is old; user knows they have AVX on the compute nodes; so they know to set SIMD and don't know RDTSCP exists / is relevant); but if we add the new nag then this case is solved well enough.  So I'm happy to adopt this solution. Thanks! Shall I abandon my patch; send reviewers here; and one of us work on Erik's feedback and/or the new nag? If we add the nag; commit message needs updating."

12243,0,Yes; I missed this basic case. Thanks for pointing out. I will cancel this patch.

12245,-1,"A (it doesn't have to be a class; structs and interfaces can be partial too) is basically a single type which has its code spread across multiple files. The main use for this is to allow a code generator (e.g. a Visual Studio designer) to ""own"" one file; while hand-written code is put in another. I've no idea whether Python/Perl have the same capabilities; I'm afraid."

12250,0,Short answer: no; there is no way for your application to be aware (for instance with an event that is raised) that its hosting process has been brutally killed.

12252,1,I agree if the file exist we should skip the conversion and print a information message
12253,0,To further explain: Apple once had a section in their agreement that specifically listed the allowable programming languages C; C++; Objective-C and Javascript. This was cause for a lot of confusion; doubts and fear. Eventually Apple stopped naming the languages. I know for a fact that even while this was in place; a variety of apps were on the store; being published; or in development that used Lua scripting in some way or another.

12267,0,"I thought that the full list of commands can be rather long; so it's best to print it only on explicit request. If there was a mechanism for printing only a subset of the commands; then that could be used here. But it may be better to wait until there are more modules ready before doing anything more complex. Having a ""commonly used"" subset here requires someone to define what those are; and also requires extra logic somewhere to communicate that subset to the help printing code. For now; I think it is best to keep things simple."

12289,0,"Josh; my proposal is to see boot as a helper for deploy driver (or to any other interface or anyone else) rather than to see it as a separate interface.   Boot should just take care of getting the bare metal booted to the required environment - whether for ironic to perform an operation OR to boot the user-requested image. Thinking in these lines; I would think boot interface should refrain from participating in cleaning.  Boot interface should participate in cleaning only if it had something to clean up on the bare metal node that would take a lot of time - in my mind there isn't anything.  We can discuss in the IRC."
12290,1,cool stuff! a good candidate to put on myfaces-commons-utils; so the user can just add the resource handler on its webapp faces-config.
12291,0,What does this have to do with the change in question?
12292,1,How can I check if I have listed all the dependencies correctly? The is an excellent tool for checking both build dependencies and dependencies by setting up a clean base system within a chroot environment. By compiling the package within pbuilder; you can easily check the build dependencies; and by testing it within a pbuilder environment; you can check the dependencies.
12293,0,Consider the following interface.
12294,0,"An easier way to do it is to make a ""globally visible"" function. AKA; declare it in a public header: and define it within your compilation ""unit"" - but outside any . As a little bonus.. it with an ""alias"".. and you can REALLy abuse it!"

12320,-1,So; the following hack seems to work; but it's really incredibly ugly IMO; as it relies on you controlling the line-height and using absolute positioning. Worse; it requires you to know how many lines there are in your text; which depends on the width of the div and the font-size; and probably requires JS to compute.Anyway; after all the above disclaimers; here's the hack: Use two divs with the same text; one on top of the other. One justified; one centered. Then clip the justified one.HTML CSS Fiddle.Of course; the above code is hard-coded for the specific width. Again; you'll probably need JS in order to compute the number of lines in the div. I'm pretty sure that until this gets implemented in Webkit you probably won't find an elegant solution for your problem.

Microsoft understood the need for basic things like enumerated types (since added to Java but it took way too long) and excellent Windows UI support and Actuate had no interest in building .NET products.

12484,0,I'm convinced that this is a combination of Windows and Vcl issues. If I understand correctly; Vcl is using outdated Windows API calls for printers; which leads to these issues. The problem is in Windows its self; but the only reason Vcl suffers this problem is because it's using outdated Windows API calls. If the Vcl were upgraded to use the newer methods; this problem presumably wouldn't happen. At least this is my hunch.
12485,1,I'm using some modifications to Glenn Berry's excellent DMV queries! However; I would like to add to the resultset the 'last server restart'; or to be more specific; the date/time the statistics for (all; the specific) DMV was reset. Since it would be quite important to know last reset when looking at the statistics; I want to make absolutely sure the date/time is accurate and shown. Question: How can you get the most accurate date/time of when a/all DMV statistic was reset? Thanks! -D

12508,-1,"Background: I'm currently debugging an application written over a custom-built GUI framework in C++. I've managed to pin down most bugs; but the bugs I'm having the most trouble with tend to have a common theme. All of them seem to be to do with the screen refreshing; redrawing or updating to match provided data. This is a pain to debug; because I can't break on every refresh; and most of this stuff is time-sensitive; so breakpoints occasionally ""fix"" the bug. Q: Does anyone have any tips for debugging Windows-based GUIs; especially regarding the refreshing of individual components?"

What is more strange is that there exists a unit-test to make sure that this path at least has the correct root folder and sometimes it will pass and will be working as expected; and then the very next debug; will point to the aforementioned folder again.

Even though it's a NullPointerException; for some reason I can hit resume and continue the execution. In case you're curious; I've put the stacktrace below. My problem though is that I simply want to stop that. It's extremely annoying and happens every now and then during the execution. But I can't find any setting anywhere which will prevent breaking inside class files. How do I avoid this?

12592,1,I have two files. File 1: a FASTA file with gene sequences; formated like this example: File 2: A simple text file with JUST the accession identification of the gene. Like so. Every entry in File 2 is somewhere in File 1; but not every entry in File 1 is in File 2. I need to remove all the entries from File 1 that are not in File 2. I feel like there must be something in the biopython module that could help me; I just don't know what. For instance; I originally thought that I could extract just the accessions from my FASTA file using the function; but this really just lands me with two files of accession numbers. I don't know how to selectively extract the accessions that are in the other file. Maybe like reading all the entries from File 2 into a dictionary and then associated that entry with its matching entry in File 1 and use to extract the whole sequence...But I really don't know....Any help anyone could give me is extremely appreciated!

12620,-1,I am building the Android OS on Mac OSX (Lion); and Eclipse as an IDE. I am trying to understand certain parts of the OS however this requires performing many searches throughout the project. These searches take 5 or 10 minutes on Eclipse; and the way they are presented is also extremely annoying. Also; I need a separate editor to open up the native files found in the OS; since if they are opened in Eclipse there is no color coding of the C++ syntax. I feel that Eclipse is really slowing me down - can anyone suggest a better IDE for browsing the Android OS (preferably free)?

12631,0,"Patch adds maybeRefreshBlocking which blocks on refreshLock. It also:  * Renames reopenLock to refreshLock * Shares the refresh logic between maybeRefresh and maybeRefreshBlocking. * Switches to use ReentrantLock instead of Semaphore(1): ** It allows to protectively obtain the lock in doMaybeRefresh (see comment in the code) ** It is better in general because it's equivalent to Semaphore(1); yet protects against an accidental bug where someone changes Semaphore(1) to Semaphore(>1).  I'll add a CHANGES entry after the patch is reviewed and we agree on the approach."
12632,1,"Hi Michael; thank you for your answer. I thought that it would not be so easy to solve this issue. Unfortunately.  I agree with you that the main problem here is that a copy action is missing and I guess AttachStrategy.persist is the right place to add some kind of copy functionality.  I started looking into the source code of the enhanced class from the test. PersistenceCapable declares a public method to copy fields (pcCopyFields(...)). Unfortunately you can't use in AttachStrategy.persist; because the entity to persist has no statemanager at this point (an exception InvalidStateException will be the result).  My suggestion is to modify the class enhancement and remove the StateManager check in pcCopyFields (I don't see the need for this check). Afterwards you can use pcCopyFields in AttachStrategy.persist by adding something like  ... if (manager.getCopyNew()) { int[] fields = new int[meta.getFields().length]; for (int i = 0; i < fields.length; i++) fields[i] = i; newInstance.pcCopyFields(pc; fields); } ...  This solution works for my testcase.  As an alternative you can modify (or add an additional) newInstance to copy the data.  I have no real experience with OpenJPA. Perhaps there is a much better solution. "
12633,1,This is simple I hope :) When I create a new web application in WSS does it need to be on port 80 if I want to point an external domain name at it? Everything is standard in terms of IIS and ports that are open i.e. port 80 is the only one open. I am guessing if I let WSS assign a port number to the new web application surely this can never be accessed externally unless I open the assigned port? Cheers

I don't think there's any point in compliance with legacy if nobody depended on the behavior (they couldn't specify the behavior before either).

12812,1,I'm trying to make a link inside the fancybox single image title. I want it to redirect me to another fancybox window (witch is inline)... I have a script that makes the whole single image a link; but this targets my document title instead of the anchor title... I really hope someone will have a solution or a better idea on how to do it!! :) Thank you thank you thank yooou! :) btw: I have almost never worked with scripts.. In depth anyways...
12813,1,New to programming and this is my very first post! Very exciting:D Thank you all in advance for sharing your expertise. I would like to be able to somehow reference the earlier created timer and to be able to extend it (call Change upon its instance perhaps?) on Button2_Click. Please take a look at the code below:
12814,1,Thanks Sandy.
12815,1,"After applying Mathias patch the sample documents works fine. Thanks Mathias."
12816,-1,Indeed; annoying even more as -i in POSTROUTING is already used in external_gateway_nat_rules (L1468)
12817,0,Hmm; after all it wouldn't fail the test; because this thread will still do the put(lastElement) below; which is the only thing that is checked. A bit flaky imo. But it should work in the meantime.
12818,1,Now why did I not think of that... :) Great idea; I'll move the files to svn!

12825,-1,"Sorry to be late getting back to this.  Been a very busy week -- just got some time this afternoon and evening. The attached ConfigurableSimpleHTTPServer.patch provides facilities to fully configure a SImpleHTTPServer for production use.  A new class HttpFactory is introduced that is   a) Configurable with the most commonly set parameters; like request core thread pool size; request socket timeout; origin server header; etc.; and   b) Specializable to supply factory methods to override all the default classes instantiated by SimpleHTTPServer.  This is important to achieve things like a bounded request queue. The parameters are also all settable in axis2.xml as part of the http TransportIn config. All axis2 tests pass; plus I've updated my application with a custom specialization of HttpFactory that is heavily configured and it also works properly. I'd like to look this over again tomorrow; and test the axis2.xml feature (not tested yet); but wanted to post this first version now to get comments on the approach. Deepal; Dims suggested you might be the right person to look this over?  Also; Oleg; I'd appreciate any thoughts you have. The patch is against my local 1.0 repository; but I expect it will apply against the svn head since simplehttpserver patch applies against 1.0 (with different offset for the hunks in one file).  If there are any issues; I'll make sure it applies cleanly against svn head tomorrow. Thanks; Chuck"

12832,-1,I have just about finished adding all of the content to each page of my website. I've noticed; however; when I navigate between links some of the pages shift to the right about 10 px or so. This is extremely irritating. All of my pages are contained within the same container using a fluid grid. However; not all pages have the same amount of content. I noticed that pages with empty divs don't shift when I navigate between them. However; if I navigate from a page with content to a page with little or no content; I see the shift. Should this be happening if all of my pages are using the same container; same fluid grid? Does this make sense? Can you sense my desperation?

The single quotes wrapping the variable disrupts the neatness of the curly brackets.  I've tried:  1. '{{$type}}' 2. '{"" . $type . ""}'  to no avail. I've spent several days on this already and can't get it to work unless I specifically include the dbprefix.  Do you have any suggestions how to go about this?"

12882,1,I've just committed this.  Thanks Arun!
12883,0,"So per discussion with Roan and yourself; we want to avoid doing shell executions just to calculate the timestamp (GitInfo uses shell exec to git's bin to get the timestamp for the latest hash); as that would be slightly expensive for the startup module (every 5 minutes) and make this method more expensive than the actual module getScript; which ironically doesn't even need shell execution. Instead let's version this module based on the hash. You can look at core's ResourceLoaderLanguageDataModule for an example: https://github.com/wikimedia/mediawiki-core/blob/6c278b6d7eb3c4516888e25a21101ad7508f48cd/includes/resourceloader/ResourceLoaderLanguageDataModule.php#L110-L127"

12887,0,The problem I was referring to is that the name of the constants is quite long; and fitting them all on the same line; you risk breaking the 80 character line limit (we use that so we can fit several files side-by-side on the same screen). Though you can use tagged initialization; and break it up over several lines; as I've demonstrated above -- also makes things more readable; and reduces the chance of mixing up the order.

I hate programs which don't even let you look at the logfile while they are running; or where the log file isn't flushed and lags behind what is happening.
12898,-1,I've been reading about MVC design for a while now and it seems officially the View calls objects and methods in the Model; builds and outputs a view. I think this is mainly wrong. The Controller should act and retrieve/update objects inside the Model; select an appropriate View and pass the information to it so it may display. Only crude and rudiementary PHP variables/simple if statements should appear inside the View. If the View gets the information it needs to display from the Model; surely there will be a lot of PHP inside the View -- completely violating the point of seperating presentation logic.

I can hit command-7 to bring of a list of logs in the left pane; select the latest one and view it in my editor window; but it is extremely annoying compared to having the console output in the debug area.

The exchange strongly recommends listening to the recovery feed only when data is needed; and leaving the multicast once I have recovered the data I need.

The messages have sequence numbers; so I can't accidentally process an old message ""left"" on the card. Is this really harming my application?"

At the end I would like to have a method with signature BaseProc(Of IBaseConf) Is it possible to write it like that or should I change it completely? The code looks like this: Any help will be really appreciate:) Thanks!
12912,1,Furthermore if you need to look at the .NET/unmanaged stack just donwload and look at your w3wp.exe processes to examine memory and other stats without having to do a remote/local debugging (just look at the .NET Tab on the properties of the process). It will show all the .NET performance counters for that particular process. Awesome tool!

12928,-1,I have an Android app that looks absolutely horrible if the user sets their font size to large or extra large (via Settings -> Display -> Font size in Ice Cream Sandwich). It just plain wasn't designed for variable font sizes; and it makes a lot of the text unreadable. I've seen applications that preserve the font size for most views; so I know that there has to be a way to do this. Is there a simple way for me to tell the application to ignore the user's font size preference? And if there isn't; how would you suggest that I go about calculating the font sizes? If nothing else; is there a way for me to retrieve the user's font size preference?
12929,0,Or if you don't want to worry about hieght calculation do this!
12930,1,hi Dan!!
12931,0,My advice is to not even worry about it. HTML and XML; unlike most languages; are almost trivial to re-indent to any style the programmer wants. In HTML I use width-2 tabs; and regularly have sections that run off the edge of the editor window. There's not really any way to avoid that unless you just skip indenting sections of the document.

12935,0,The patch also removes FreqProxMergeState; because we don't have to interleave posting lists from different threads anymore of course.
12936,0,Looks like your change did not fix the findbugs. But i think you need to suppress the findbugs warning : HRS_REQUEST_PARAMETER_TO_HTTP_HEADER. It is suppressed for jobdetails.jsp in MAPREDUCE-1185.
12937,1,Thanks Todd; glad to be on board!
12938,1,Hi Rich!  Thanks for taking the time to move forward on this.  I didn't have any JUnit problems at all with Maven2 when I installed it.  But clearly we're in a world of hard-to-replicate behaviors here. :)  What is the exact problem you're seeing?

12945,0,As an aside; if you can use a pull parser and not a SAX parser. They're much easier to work with. With SAX you have to worry about saving state between the callbacks.
12946,-1,I have a function name called setValue; used in many classes. Also; i have a global function by the same name. When i press C-]; it goes to arbitrary setValue function. How do i directly jump to the global setValue function? It is really pain to use tnext every time to find if the function global.

13026,0,The patch also removes FreqProxMergeState; because we don't have to interleave posting lists from different threads anymore of course.

13053,1,I would recommend 2 things: - Calculate and combine polygons that are touching. This involves a LOT of processing and hard math; but I've done it so I know it's possible. - Create your own overlay instead of using KML in PNG format; while you combine them in the previous suggestion. You'll have to create a LOT of PNGs but it is blazing fast on the client. Good luck :)

13081,1,Marco; BTW I have only helped Santosh Malviya for OFBIZ-1468 where ever he needs and reviewed his work. After that Its only his effort to convert java to minilang + testing the patch. So majority of credit goes to Santosh Malviya :)
13082,1,Well; the fix looks good enough. Seems there is a lot of dead or half-broken code around st_print_frame() / exn_print_stack_trace(); but those deserve good refactoring all in all.

The type conversion suffixes are more than just nice since the main point of the ValueParser is to parse values.  If you don't care about type conversion; then you may as well just put the source map into the context. Anyway; i'm going to see if i can make both work somehow.  If i can't; then expect me to resurrect the sub in a later version where complete backwards compatibility isn't necessary."

Having the ""link"" won't be sufficient; you need to opt-in to the beta or alpha via Google + or Google Group. Please note that even if you properly opt-in via Google + or Google Groups as defined by the developer; you will need to wait several hours (perhaps 2-8 hours) for your status to propagate via Google Play.

13292,0,There are many libraries that make cross-platform development easier on their own; but making a complete wrapper for all platforms ends up being either small and highly customized; or massive and completely ridiculous.

13295,0,A simpler approach (rather than using a binding group) is to use the default button's click event to set the focus to itself.

13360,0,A couple of issues with your code that may be causing the problem is as follows:Do not EVER escape binary data prior to insertionInserting binary data from an upload into the database is a huge no-no. This can inadvertently lead to some very malicious attacks on your server that extend beyond simple SQL injection.That being said; it is not know what the field type is that you are trying to store into; nor how large the image file is. Storing a 2GB upload as a field in a database is probably not a wise idea; but if you wanted to store large images; it is recommended to stream the data into a BLOB field.For smaller files; you can them safely into fields or if allocated enough space.

13391,-1,You probably meant that the comments should explain why; not how? But even that is missing here.

13395,-1,Not an answer; but why on earth would you want 32;000 items in a combo box? That is a terrible way to store that much data.
13396,0,It probably is; but what happens when somebody upgrades the libvirt? Do we require vdsm restart as well? Or will it suddenly start working?
13397,-1,I agree with this. For *non-essential services* increasing timeouts is incredibly frustrating.

13405,1,Wow! I have an idea of cool web 2.0 app; and i will share it with you now. Do you remember this xkcd strip: So; imagine the web-service on which high-school students list people they dated (links to facebook profiles or smth); and the service provides recommendations whom to date next to create symmetric graph or any other fancy graph configuration.
13406,-1,To push it to Heroku; you'll have to add it to your repo. Why don't you want to commit it? It's recommended to commit Gemfile.lock in your repo (unless you're developing a gem): When developing an app; check in your Gemfile.lock; since you will use the bundler tool across all machines; and the precision enforced by bundler is extremely desirable for applications.

13408,-1,There are an awful lot of C/C++ libraries out there; most no longer updated. There's not much for C#; but I have seen a couple. I haven't really used any of them in anger; so I can't give any recommendations. I would start with and see if you find anything of use there. Alternatively; a search for on sourceforge.net has plenty of results.

13414,0,I know you can have pre and post build events at a project level; but I want to stop and start a service at the beginning and end of a build of the solution -- i.e. when I do a 'Build Solution' the service is stopped and the last action of the build is to re-start the service. There are no build events on the solution property page; so what should I do? I'm guessing that I can add tasks to the msbuild file but I'm afraid I don't understand the relationship between VS and msbuild at all. Does VS execute msbuild with the SLN file?

I can read from this error log that the application is trying to access to port 1..4 and I do not have no idea what on earth is going on. each node is on the virtual machine on the Virtual Box Hypervisor. Both OS is centOS. Here is my cassandra.yaml (the cassandra.yaml of target file is also configured the same way) thrift_max_message_length_in_mb: 16 Can anybody give me advice? I am really suffering as hell.
13424,0,You could check whether your CODE_FRAGMENT also is an instance of CODE_FRAGMENT.

13433,1,"Hi Neil; Thanks for the advice ...  > On the other hand; if you can design a handler that knows how to > make appropriate calls to the scanner's sendChars() method so that > the buffer gets flushed when a maximum buffer size is reached; then > perhaps a pluggable handler wouldn't be necessary since the default > behaviour would always work when an application has chosen to set > this limit.  The code I have; as written; does have the pluggable handler notion; since I didn't want to arbitrarily couple the XMLBuffer class implementation (or worse; it's interface) to the scanner. I didn't go so overboard as to allow multiple registered handlers; or anything like that; this seemed simple enough without being a hack.  > I'd also observe that XMLBuffer has to check to use the > infelicitously named ""insureCapacity()"" method to make sure it's > large enough  Yes; this is where I implemented the full-handler invocation. It's more or less as you describe. Once I get everything cleaned up; I'll post the patch here; you'll probably find it to be entirely unsurprising.  I think what I'll end up doing to allow user-configurable buffer size limit will be to add a setter method on Parser and AbstractDOMParser; something like setInputBufferSize(). I think that would be most consistent with the existing API. Sound ok?"

13447,-1,Lastly; I don't see any styling data. Does your project have some CSS defined somewhere?
13448,0,This is done now. The regex will now not be applied on some invalid versions where it was before. Some types of invalid versions will still match the regex; though that is outside of the concerns of this function. It is not a version number validator after all.
13449,1,ahhh sweet; i'm guessing you have an IDE that does this? If the tests pass commit; this kinda crap goes out of date too fast!

13453,0,When contributing to a very old; and apparently no longer maintained; open-source or public domain project; is it suggested practice to follow the original author's coding style even if it is terrible?

13465,0,{quote} you lost me there ... they can use the exact same configs – that's kind of the point: testing the exact example configs as we ship them (with <lib/> declarations that point at dirs which may or may not contain jars depending on what contribs are built; and request handler / response writer declarations configured that use lazyloading to dynamic load things as needed.

13471,1,@Daniel Lee: That is an excellent video! I had downloaded Automapper; but wasn't sure how to use it on anything more than the simplest object mappings. I love how some of the concepts shown help keep the code DRY.
13472,1,Yes it can be resolved. Thank You!

13475,-1,In theory; you could apply that philosophy to every single question on SO. But it would be terribly boring to do so.
13476,-1,I cannot seem to figure out why the phpunit target does not output any test results even though I have tests in position. The problem I am finding is there is no indication as to what the problem is! Incredibly frustrating. The output is as follows: My build.xml is as follows: My system: Vista; PHP 5.2.9; PHPUnit 3.4; PHPUnderControl; CruiseControl
13477,-1,Is there a way to reuse a 3rd party control reference? For example; I have this referenced in my App.xaml I don't want to repeat this 3rd party control xml namespace on each page/control that needs a control from the library. Is there anyway to centralize these references and use the prefix defined here? The possibility of each control having a different prefix is also worrisome. In asp.net you would put a reference in the web.config and it was available globally; I'm just looking to see if there is a similar method in WPF.

13487,0,Say what the commit does (add release notes; apply CSS only to content; formatting fix). If you want to put an ID; put it in the body (and using the git SHA of the previously merged commit is better so it works on both GitHub etc. and Gerrit).
